Why, you may ask? Is it because Paper Mario, a game so jam packed with adventure and amusement, is priced at a mere $10? Is it because Paper Mario has aged way better than most games that came out last week on current generation consoles? Is it because of the undeniable charm and winning formula that the Paper Mario series has had from the beginning? The answer is yes, to all of these things, and so much more!\", u'Paper Mario was released originally in 2001 on the N64, meant to be the spiritual successor to the classic ', u\" for the SNES, developed by Square. Paper Mario was made by Intelligent Systems, Nintendo's original in-home studio (formally called R&D1) who have also made countless Fire Emblem games as well. It seems they were a perfect choice to craft this game.\", u'Clearly, the most distinguishable aspect of Paper Mario, made obvious by its title, is the artistic style of the game itself. Everything is meant to look like a pop-up book, from the stylized 3-D backgrounds and surroundings, to the 2-D paper characters that grace the screen. To see the Paper characters run around the screen and interact with one another is just a delight. This game OOZES charm out of every 64-bit pore. Like all virtual console releases, this one features visual updates by being sharper and more vibrant. This has not served most of the N64 re-releases well, as it shows just how ugly they are. Paper Mario does not suffer this fate. The style and execution is so unique that even today, Paper Mario is very enjoyable to just sit back and take in.'][u\" The lower graphical power really doesn't effect the visual enjoyment this game has in store. Don't expect Super Paper Mario resolution, however! The music is also undeniably awesome, despite being on clunky N64 era synthesizers. The sound effects are also fantastic as they conjure up beloved childhood memories of playing Mario, most notably \", u'. Great job! One thing I must say about the whole experience is that this game is a giant trip down Mario nostalgia road, and that is a giant compliment.', u'The gameplay, even as a JRPG styled game, is very unique. It is more of an RPG first, a platformer second, and it works well. The third entry in the Paper Mario franchise,', u' on the Wii has hardly any RPG elements, so it is great to play the original game which features a lot more RPG elements. All of the characters are lovable, and the party members that join Mario in his quest to stop Bowser for the umpteenth time are a blast to have along for the ride. Paper Mario and ', u' employ a brilliant take on the turn-based battle system of traditional JRPGs. Not only is the adorable \"battle stage\" setting a great gimmick, fighting enemies is far more dynamic because of special button prompts that help you be more effective. It\\'s amazing how such a simple system makes turn-based battles fun and stretches out their entertainment value. I enjoyed the battle system throughout the game and did not get bored of it. I have never been a fan of turn-based battles, but Paper Mario does it right. The puzzles in Paper Mario are great as well. Always fun, never gimmicky.', u'The story of Paper Mario is neither original, nor is it groundbreaking, but it is well implemented. At the beginning, Bowser once again kidnaps Peach, and in a darker turn of events than normal, beats the stuffing out of Mario. Bowser has stolen the Star Rod, which grants his every wish, which in Bowser\\'s case is to be made invincible. Mario recovers and goes on a quest to free the only things that can help him defeat his nemesis, 7 powerful star spirits that used to watch over the star rod. Bowser has imprisoned them though, and placed under the care of his boss minions. It\\'s an interesting take on the traditional tale, no? Even if the destination at the end of the road is not entirely new or groundbreaking, it is the journey that counts, and this game does it right. Each \"world\" location is an entirely unique experience, and the characters are wonderful to interact with. Paper Mario is VERY dialogue heavy, which may turn some away, but it didn\\'t earn any negative points from me at all. The dialogue is HILARIOUS at times, and this very quirky sense of humor is prevalent throughout the whole game.', u\"Most virtual console releases are so lame in comparison to today's releases, that even $10 seems like a steep price. Paper Mario could be priced twice that and still feel like a great deal. To think that this game that could take 30+ hours is priced at a mere $10 is just the cherry on top. I have played all three Paper Mario games, and I have to say that the style of the first two are my cup o' tea, and it was great for me to play through Paper Mario (this was my first time playing through). I highly recommend downloading this game. You will not regret the decidedly amazing deal on this incredible, timeless gemstone from the N64. The visuals and sound are ridiculously charming, the gameplay is unique and engaging, and the journey of the game is absolutely fantastic! Buy it, absorb it, LOVE IT!\"]", ["\n  Released in 2000 for the Nintendo 64, Paper Mario is the spiritual successor to the classic Super NES title \"Super Mario RPG\". That game had Squaresoft (now known as Square Enix) and Nintendo collaborate on one of the best RPG titles, blending Nintendo characters and humor with Final Fantasy battle tactics and story telling. This time around Nintendo takes full reign and the RPG adventures of Mario continues on.", "Even if you never played Super Mario RPG, you can appreciate all that this game offers: a compelling story, a huge world with different areas to explore, appearances from every character in the Mario universe, new enemies and bosses, classic turn based strategy and tactics, off the wall humor and a progressing difficulty curve. This game will keep you busy as you progress through the main story mode (and completing the side quests, if you choose to.)", "The graphics are a blend of 2D characters with 3D backgrounds, all crisp and colorful. The music and sound effects capture the mood of every area you explore. The controls are easy to get into and you get prompts in the early part of the game, showing you how to pull off moves and use items so you won't get confused. Overall, it's a game that plays well and is so fun that you want to see what happens at the end. I downloaded this title through the Virtual Console service for the Wii and I do not regret it. I missed out on buying the actual N64 cartridge so if you can't find it and you want a quality RPG-ish Mario title, you cannot go wrong with Paper Mario. ******HIGHLY RECOMMENDED******\n"], ["\n  You will not regret this game.

(If you're only going to visit the Parks for three or four days as part of a longer trip, however, it's probably more detail than you would need.)  We recently visited the two Parks for a total of twelve days, and I found this Guide extremely helpful.  Unusually for a guidebook, I actually read it pretty much straight through before we left.  It's an enjoyable read, even aside from the quality of the information it presents.\", u\"The Moon Guidebooks only seem to have emerged onto the scene within the past several years, and for many readers they are still likely to be less familiar than such old standbys as Fodor's or even Lonely Planet.  But I've used several guides from this publisher now and have found them to be uniformly excellent.\", u'In terms of the book\\'s coverage, you get 70 pages on Yellowstone Park itself; 64 pages on the Yellowstone Gateway communities; 33 on Grand Tetons National Park; and 91 on the Jackson Hole area.  There\\'s also a 33-page \"Background\" section that provides interesting information about the geography and climate, flora and fauna, and the often controversy-ridden history of both Parks, and a 4-page section on avoiding or dealing with bear attacks.  Finally, there\\'s a solid 6-page bibliography with suggestions for other reading.', u\"The book includes an abundance of maps - in the sections focused on sightseeing (as opposed to where to stay and eat), you'll typically find at least one map every four pages.\"][u'  There are interesting, even compelling sidebars, such as the one about \"Beaver Dick\" Leigh, an English immigrant and early resident of Jackson Hole who on Christmas Day 1887 watched his wife Jenny, newborn baby, and four other children all die of smallpox and left a heartbreaking account of the experience, which the author quotes in full (p. 113).', u'This guidebook is thorough, accurate, and useful, but beyond that, I enjoyed the glimpses of the author\\'s personality that he lets come through in his writing.  \"The Buffalo Bill Museum is a real joy,\" he tells you, although his assessment of the Cody Firearms Museum is more restrained: \"it\\'s interesting even for those of us who consider the proliferation of guns a national menace. . . . All told, this museum houses more implements of destruction and mayhem than you\\'re likely to see at an NRA convention.\"  Or:  \"For those who love history, Trail Town is an incredible treasure trove without the fancy gift shops and commercial junk that tag along with most such endeavors.  This is the real thing, low-key and genuine.\"', u'He also writes effective descriptions that will help you decide what you may want to see:', u'\"Togwotee Pass is one of the most scenic drives imaginable, with Ramshorn Peak peeking down from the north for several miles until the road plunges into dense lodgepole forests (Shoshone National Forest) with lingering glimpses of the Pinnacle Buttes.  At the crest it emerges into the grass-, willow-, and flower-bedecked meadows with Blackrock Creek winding through.  Whitebark pine and Englemann spruce trees cover the nearby slopes. . . . Togwotee Pass is a complete shock after all the miles of sagebrush and grassland that control the heartland of Wyoming.  It\\'s like entering another world - one of cool, forested mountains and lofty peaks instead of the arid land with horizonwide vistas.\"', u\"In short, this is an excellent guidebook to Yellowstone, the Grand Tetons, and the immediately adjacent areas.  If you're planning a more extensive ramble around other parts of Wyoming, then you'll want to check out the author's Wyoming volume for Moon, which tops out at a comprehensive 728 pages.  (The Yellowstone-Grand Tetons coverage in the statewide volume runs about 180 pages, about half as long as in this separate volume specifically focusing on the Parks.)\"]", ["\n  This is THE most helpful guidebook to take on a trip to the two parks.  There is SO MUCH to see and do--and lots of it is \"off the beaten path\".  This book contains it all--from the hard-to-find cabins that are run by the locals to the dozens of white water rafting companies!  And all the information is there--phone numbers, websites, prices, times, etc.  Although the book does not give a review per se to every hotel or activity, the comments are plentiful, are very helpful and I've found these evaluations to be right on the money.  The maps are also plentiful, very clear and well-marked.  There is a section of  information on all the cities that surround the parks and what to see and do there.  There are also sections on background history of the parks, park etiquette, environmental issues, and traveling tips.  Planning ahead for your visit is a must as the accommodations and activities fill up quickly--and this book gives you all the tools you need to make your trip to this most beautiful spot in the USA the trip of a lifetime.\n"], ["\n  When I'm planning a trip the first thing I do is order a Moon Handbook for the area in which I want to travel.

Nintendo made an announcement that 3DS cards will go on sale at a later date.', u\"I'm writing this review for two reasons.\", u\"1. To balance out all of the negative reviews because of the price.  Amazon has finally priced this at the $20 it should be, so there's no need for those negative reviews anymore.\", u\"2. Because of all the great games for WiiWare and the Virtual Console (currently, there isn't much to buy on the DSI. Edit: This has definitely changed since this was initially written). We all know about the scores of excellent classic games for all of the old systems on the Virtual Console. But WiiWare is proving to be truly impressive. Its home to extremely fun and innovative games that couldn't have existed without digital downloads. Among the greats are World of Goo, Swords and Soldiers, Mega Man 9, Toki Tori, and Bit.Trip:Beat. And many more promising games are on their way such as Icarian:Kindred Spirits and Cave Story. Also, now that they've added easy access to games stored on the SD card, you shouldn't need to worry about space constraints.\", u'Oh, and a side note to Amazon.com: Please make download codes for more WiiWare games like you did for World of Goo.  Its very convenient.', u\"Edit: The price fluctuates a lot more than it should.  I've contacted Amazon.com about this problem.  I've seen it anywhere from $19.49-$25.00.  Buy when its low if you can wait.\", u'Edit - Winter 2009: Icarian:Kindred Spirits was worth looking forward to, but apparently Cave Story is still on the way. Two more Bit.Trip games, Core and Void, have been released, and they are totally different, yet just as great as the first.'][u\" Rubik's Puzzle Galaxy: RUSH (by the makers of Toki Tori), Contra ReBirth, and LostWinds: Winter of the Melodias are a few more to add to the list of great games.  Hopefully its more than just a rumor, but it looks like Konami's next remake may be Jackal - a potentially promising co-op.\", u'Edit - Spring 2010: Mega Man 10 and Cave Story have been released.  Mega Man 10 is, as expected, another excellent sequel.  Cave Story was worth the very long wait.  Its an extremely good platformer/action/adventure game along the lines of Castlevania and Metroid.  The story is excellent, and the combat is just as good.  There are multiple endings and other game modes to give it a high replay value.  Its been a free game on the internet for years, but they remade all of the graphics and sound for this version.  This is the kind of game to spend those Nintendo points on.', u'Edit - Spring 2011: Many more notable Virtual Console, WiiWare, and DSIWare games have been released (several Bit.Trip games, Bejeweled 2, And Yet It Moves, Airport Mania, and others come to mind), but recently, I\\'ve been hesitant to purchase them.  There have been rumors of a new Nintendo console.  This is exciting news, but it leaves me wondering what will happen to all of my purchased content on the Wii?  If the DSI to 3DS transition is any indication, it will probably be okay but not perfect.  In the next month or so, you\\'ll be able to transfer your DSIWare games to your 3DS.  I\\'m guessing \"transfer\" means that you won\\'t be able to play them on the DSI anymore.  Also, any leftover points you have on the DSI will NOT be transferred to the 3DS (because the 3DS uses real currency rather than points), and some games may not transfer at all.  This solution sounds far from ideal.', u\"Nintendo really needs to implement an account system where your games are tied to an account rather than a console.  It really boils down to this: When the Wii 2 (or whatever they're going to call it) is released, I'd like to be able to log in to it with my Nintendo account, and download all of the games I purchased for the Wii.  If I knew that all of the games I've purchased on the Wii would work with the Wii 2, I'd be buying a lot more of them.\"]", ["\n  FYI, the conversion rate is 100 points = $1.

Nintendo has many great old games available already and is adding more regularly (generally about once a week).', u'Basic information:  100 Wii Points roughly equals 1 dollar.  You should never pay more for a Wii Points card because you can buy the points directly from Nintendo at a rate of 100 to the dollar.  On the flip side if you can get these cards cheaper (and sometimes you can buy them at a bit of a discount) you get a great deal.', u\"What's available:  There are new games being released all the time.  I have a wishlist a mile long for these games, but some of my favorites include Zelda, the original Castlevania, Ninja Gaiden, Donkey Kong Country, Golden Axe, Super Mario Brothers and Super Mario World, and Mario 64.  Again--almost every week there's something new.  A current list is available on Nintendo's website.\", u\"Game Cost:  The cost for classic games varies a little but is fairly uniform.  NES games start at 500 points (at this time there is only one game that I'm aware of for the NES that costs more).  Most Super NES, Genesis, and TG 16 games cost around 800 points, and N64 games run about 1000.  Considering a nostalgia trip used to sometimes cost as much as the original game (the original Zelda used to run about $50, and that's if you had an old Nintendo to run it on) these games are a great deal.\", u\"Why buy the card?: I purchase most of my points directly from Nintendo without using these cards.  So what purpose do they serve?  Simple--they're great for gifts.\"][u\"  I love that these come in 2000 point increments--it means my friends and family have a cheap gift idea for me and can give me something I'll really enjoy rather than trying to pick out a game for me themselves.  And of course if you've got a gift card or discount for your favorite retailer you can pick them up cheaper.  It's a great alternative to just buying the points on your Wii.\", u'Overall this is a great way to get your hands on some classic games.

Even first-party titles by the often heralded Nintendo today all too often show low production values (Wii Play), rehashed and tired gameplay and graphics (Mario Kart Wii, Animal Crossing: City Folk) even though they are made by such a large corporation.', u\"But then there's World of Goo, a two-man project (2D Boy's Kyle Gabler and Ron Carmel) that's innovative and beautiful, has great Danny Elfman-ish music and sound-design reminiscent of Loco Roco. It's genuinely funny - the humor, a bit dark at times (a la Braid or Psychonauts) and contains many Internet-community and computing references (similar to that in the new Sam & Max episodes and Portal) and - if not braking the 4th wall - then at least tapping it. The level-design brings Lemmings to mind.\", u'The general idea is to use the titular Goo balls to build a physics-enforced structure to a pipe somewhere on the level through which the remaining goo-balls can escape. In standard puzzle-game fashion you are gradually presented with new an varying challenges both in terms of the environments and through new goo-balls with different properties such as those that can jump, are flammable or detachable.', u'Through-out the game you are accompanied by the mysterious sign-painter. Hints and story elements are presented in a Braid/Portal-esque way, partly through the environments but mainly by the sign-painters posts. These are often funny and much like the levels themselves comments on society and pop-culture, bringing greater depth to the game and making you really feel the plight of the poor goo balls...'][u' as strange as it may sound.', u\"However even if you - like my wife - skip the signs all together, there is a fantastically addictive and fun game here that everyone deserves to play. My only gripe with the game is that it was a bit too easy. I burnt through the 50 levels in just five days, about 10-hours. But then there is the Tower of Goo mode in which you build as high as you can and compare your results in real-time to others around the world who's records hover as clouds in the sky, providing constant incentive to manage just a little bit higher. The goo balls you build with in this stage are the excess balls from the main stages, so by going back to improve your results in those stages you can gain more balls to build your tower with.\", u\"World of Goo is the best thing to happen to WiiWare and one of the best things on Wii period. For those who don't have a Wii there are also PC and Mac versions and with a Linux version on it's way there is little excuse not to buy this game. Yes, now we come to the darker side of gaming, piracy. This game is DRM-free and while DRM won't stop the determined pirate and I applaud 2D Boy for putting their faith in their audience... unfortunately piracy of World of Goo is a real problem. This is not a game by a large corporation swimming in money, so please try the demo and if you like it, buy it.\"]", ["\n  The Wii has a lot of good games, but most are overlooked. The same probably happened to this awesome puzzle game, World of Goo.", " The fun is in using the remote to experiment with the little goo caracters and  then using them to form a connection to the exit. As levels progress, the Goo's get different properties that add a lot of variety to the game. Up to 3 friends can use a Wiimote and help with the levels, making this a great co-op experience. I had a lot of fun with my friends, and even non gamers who like to point out solutions that often work!", "Anyone who enjoys a good brain teaser and just plain old fun should download this as soon as they can.\n"], ["\n  Lately I've been underwhelmed by many of the Wii Ware titles out there, but if this is the new direction that Nintento is taking with the platform, I say keep it coming!  This is one of the most innovative games out there, regardless of platform (although the use of the Wii wand does give the game a more organic feel than twiddling buttons would).  Like any good game, it's easy to learn yet hard to master.  Also, the physics of the game are nearly real-world perfect.

Now that I have used both easy menu and expert menu I can comment on both.', u'One caveat is that the best quality is achieved only when you record upto 110 minutes in one sitting, you can still record for longer duration with slight compromise in the quality of the recording. SO MAKE SURE UR TAPES ARE NOT LONGER THAN 70 MINUTES DURATION BEFORE U START RECORDING,  if they are longer than 70 minutes duration then you can adjust the recording time on the menu pretty easily to fix this issue.', u'overall the converted video quality is decent, I personally use cocusoft products to reconvert dvd files to MP4 for palyback on quicktime.', u'Of note though you will need a seperate 3.5 to 3.5 mm cable or 3.5 to rca audio cable to convert audio cassettes to mp3 or wma format, I ordered them from amazon and recieved them today.', u'I am using 3.5mm to RCA cable via vidbox to convert my audio cassette files to WMA files, and LO IT WORKS LIKE A CHARM, AWESOME!!!.'][u'I have previously tried audacity but found it complicated and confusing to use, but with Honestech the audio-file conversion is a breeze!!!, truly, just remember few things.', u'1.

Now this one is important, when you record using 3.5mm to rca audio cable via vidbox I have very little hissing only, however if you use 3.5 mm to 3.5 mm cable bypassing vidbox there is lots of hissing noise, so i think either the vidbox has a built in filter or it just does good job eliminating hissing, I have so far used only one type of 3.5mm to 3.5 mm cable to record the audio so unsure if the quality of the cable i used had anything to do with it??, anywayz if you want to convert cassette to wma then connecting to your computer through the vidbox probably gives you the best quality.', u'I shall try out various setting for video recording over next few weeks and update this review again.', u'Once again the audio conversion software works like a charm, I am happy with this software, so far it has been a great buy, instead of spending a fortune at walgreens or sams or other stores trying to get your old tapes converted, with he help of this software and a laptop you can get it done at home!!!, wow, I am happy.', u'Overall this product works as advertised and is a winner, thanks Honestech for a great product.', u'ADDENDUM - 01/06/2010', u'Advanced Video options are nice to use as well.', u'You can convert either in 4:3 of 16:9 format, one can convert the VHS to WMV format and store it on hard disc whils the basic simple format only lets you burn it onto dvd immediately after aquring the content.

I wanted to convert a VHS tape to a DVD. I researched several products and based on the reviews I chose this one. And, boy was I glad that I did. Yes, it cost a little more than some of the others but it was worth it. The set-up and installation took only 5 minutes. The process of recording the VHS tape then burning the DVD was easy. The instructions were great. The first tape I converted would play on my desktop but there was no audio. I called their Tech Support (someone actually answered the phone). The tech walked me through a few steps to make sure that the tape was being recorded properly - it was. He then had me update my Windows Media Player and the DVD played fine (both audio and video).

My choices were to outsource this at $10 per tape, purchase a VCR to DVd recorder (about $210.00), or take a chance on software. For the cost of the program, I figured there was not much risk in trying the software first.  The beginning of the installation process was ok, but the program did not work after registration.  It appeared that another option was going to be necessary.  However; I kept digging around, and determined that the driver for the interface (a little white box which comes with the software) between my VCR machine and the laptop did not come with the installation disk. Worse, this problem was not disclosed in the installation instructions, so luckily I was tech savy enough to eventually figure it out myself.  Go to the product website, sift thru the various drivers available, and find the one that matches (Windows 7, 64 bit).  After that drama for several days, the next thing was to learn to work the program.  The simple burn to DVD option worked like a charm, but the Advanced, which gives you a lot of options on content, etc. took some more time to use.", "Anyway, now I am very pleased with this product, and I enthusiastically endorse it, if you are willing to get in there and get your hands a little dirty figuring it out.

Corpse Party is a top-down RPG-esque style of play, with 16/32 bit characters.  Book of Shadows is barely a game at all, and more of a interactive 'choose your own adventure.'  The cons are assuming most people don't understand what they're getting into.", "That said, however, the tale of Heavenly Host Elementary is very enticing.  The story alone is worth the playthrough.  This particular 2 for one sale is a huge bargain, considering the time it will take to complete.", "If you are looking for a gripping story the likes you have not seen before, this is highly recommended, you will have to keep going until the end.  If you are looking for engaging gameplay with quick controls and fast paced action, this is not the game for you.\n"], "[u\"I've been curious in this game for a while but the price for the individual game was kind of high for a game that i wasn't sure if i'd enjoy/be interested in finishing so i never got it.  When I saw this combo pack, figured what the heck.  Glad I did!  The combo pack is for PSVita only for some reason despite the original games being for PSP.  Sadly this means the game is in PSP sized graphic, but stretched to fit the larger Vita screen.  There was no distortion since the Vita screen is the same ratio, but it does mean the lines are not as clear and everything is more pixelated.  It's a bit annoying (I wish Vita provides the ability to display in native display setting like the 3DS does) but not unmanageable.  In fact I played the entire first game this way before I even thought of looking up how to play  in native setting (and then found out i can't lol).\", u'This game, I will say right now, is NOT for everyone.', u'The story is about a group of High School kids who performed a ritual and ended up trapped in the Heavenly Host Elementary School in a separate dimension.  Gameplay for the first game (Corpse Party) is like an old-school RPG but there are no battles.  You run around as your character sprite and perform things like finding keys to open doors and reading flyers, newspaper, and notes for the background story as to how the Heavenly Host school became like this.', u'In some ways, this game really isn\\'t that \"scary\" in the typical sense.  You run around in third person and there are no jump scares or anything, and the scariest bits are when needing to avoid running into slow walking ghost sprites during some parts of the gameplay.  The characters are cute sprites or anime style expression stills, along with some full screen event still shots.'][u'  Compared to games like, say, Amnesia, this game really isn\\'t \"scary\".  I can\\'t play ANY horror games at all (attempts at playing Silent Hill 2 ended in 5 minutes and then i gave up and handed the controller to my friend LOL) but i was able to play this.', u'What\\'s \"scary\" about this game is more like how utterly disturbing it can get with the death scenes for Wrong Endings, or even just many of the events that occurs in the game that\\'s part of the Canon story.  It is 100% fully voiced in Japanese with English subtitle, and many of the times it\\'s how the voice actors/actresses portrays the character\\'s fear and pain that really made things disturbing as all f*ck.  I don\\'t even know how they did this, but somehow even some of the dead character sprites can look downright garish nevermind it\\'s all super pixelated and tiny as hell.  x___x  At the same time, despite the goriness, I couldn\\'t help but really sympathize and feel absolutely awful a lot of times with how things occurred in the game.  The story is quite good (though not super surprising) and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  The ending (the real ending) actually made me bawl.  ^^;;', u'The second game, Book of Shadows, is not at all RPG-like.  It plays like a visual novel, with movement done automatically by selecting \"rooms\" or squares to go to.  The Sprite will automatically move to the square selected, and then event scenes occur completely via text and still images.  You can also search around the room by point and clicking.  Book of Shadows is also not exactly a direct sequel - most of the chapters were \"alternate events\" or \"past events\" to the first Corpse Party game.  This means several of the chapters occurred during the first game, with an \"what if\" pov of if a certain character didn\\'t make a certain choice (I took it more like events of what happened to the non-playable characters from the first game).  A few of them were also past events that kind of added a bit more back story.  Apparently only the final chapter, Blood Drive (which is the name of a newer Corpse Party game), is a direct continuation of the first game (I haven\\'t gotten that far yet, I\\'m about halfway through Book of Shadows).', u\"Personally I did prefer the gameplay of the first game more than Book of Shadows, but both are quite enjoyable and really made me cringe and cry several times.  Both games are INCREDIBLY text heavy (the second even more so than the first).  The first game had no way of fast forwarding during replays, the second game did.  For many of the Wrong Endings in the first game it required you to create separate save points regularly if you want to collect all of the Wrong Endings, and if you don't read guides first to know when to make the saves, it could end up making you replay the chapter many many times (this is a big complaint from a lot of players).  To speed that up even a little, highly recommend setting the Message Speed to ALL in the options in order to get the text to move faster.  I had to replay Chapter 2 something like 5 times from beginning to get all of the bad endings and i didn't find it particularly much more annoying.\", u'The first game\\'s Wrong Ends are also generally more difficult to get to, with several of them so invested that literally the choice is made at the beginning of the chapter, but you\\'d have to play it through all the way to the end of the chapter to get the Wrong End.  Book of Shadows, on the other hand, the Wrong Ends tend to happen immediately after you make the wrong choice, so you\\'re unlikely to spend half an hour in the chapter only for it to turn out to be the Wrong Ending instead.  It\\'s both a blessing and a curse - I find the first game to be more immersive with the Wrong Ends since you actually played through all these events that ultimately came to the bad end.  The second game\\'s Wrong Ends felt more like a side \"oh oops this happens if you select wrong.\"', u'Once again this game is INCREDIBLY TEXT HEAVY.  For people who honestly just doesn\\'t like to read, this is not the game for you (i have a friend who kept falling asleep when he tried to play Phoenix Wright lol).  That said, this game has an AMAZING localization.  I found out recently that XSEED did the localization - all I could say at the time was \"I thought so!\" because XSEED also did the localization for one of my favorite PSP games, Trails in the Sky, which was also text heavy.  XSEED managed to translate incredibly well every single piece of text in these games - the only localization I was a little iffy on was Seiko\\'s whom they made to sound much more pervy than she really was saying in Japanese.  That said, I think they were trying to bring across her way of speech (which can be kinda like a perverted old man) and since there\\'s no American idea of how a \"pervy old man\" sounds, they had to really dramaticize her speech.  Aside from Seiko, everyone else\\'s speech translation were awesome, there were no mistakes that I can remember seeing.  Once more, XSEED has done another amazing job on these text heavy games!!!!  I LOVE YOU XSEED!!!', u\"If you are an anime person, the first series I thought of when playing this was Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni (When the Cicadas Cry/When They Cry) anime series, which were also drawn in childish cute ways and ended up being rather horrific.  If you enjoyed Higurashi or Umineko (When the Seagulls Cry), then I think you'd enjoy this as well.\", u'In the American/Western market this game is really quite unique and I highly recommend it for people who enjoys horror/mystery series like Higurashi, Umineko, or enjoys Japanese style horror games or movies.']", ["\n  Corpse Party has quickly become my favorite horror anime. I just found this gem last week and have already ordered the DVD set and a poster. I also bought a PS Vita just for these two games. Of course, being able to play Resident Evil 2 and other PS1 classics is a big bonus. I was hesitant at first as I wasn't sure how the purchase and game voucher would work, but have no fear, it is painless, absolutely simple, and impossible to mess up. Amazon is a great place to purchase Vita games as both of these were $20 opposed to $20ea on the PSN. As for the game itself, I only ordered it yesterday and have had little hands on experience with the game but boy is it engaging and captures your attention right at the beginning. Before people purchase this unkowingly, I imagine the gameplay isn't for everyone. It isn't like your standard RPG. Its story driven and the original indie voice actors are amazing. You definitely do not need to be a fan of the series to enjoy this although if you are there is no way you won't like these two games.\n"]], "rating_change": "", "video": "", "current_price": "$19.99", "count_customer_reviews": "26 customer reviews", "previous_price": "", "image": ["http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61dVZGZmhZL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg"], "category_path": "Video Games / Digital Games / PlayStation Vita / Digital Games"}

I love everything about the presentation in this game: the characters are adorable, the story is hilarious and absurd, and the cel-shaded approach has never looked finer. The time traveling plot and assortment of anthropomorhpic animals takes me back to the days of shows like \"DuckTales\".', u'There is, however, a complaint that I have with this game: I wish I had control of Sly Cooper for greater lengths of time (ALL the time would be even better). While Murray and Bentley are cool characters, and they make for an awesome family/team, I found that I began sighing every time one of their segments began loading. When Sly is in control, this platformer can attain a certain level of \"zen\" as you engage in your chains of stealthy feats- leap, perch, climb, balance, strike, repeat (and the controls are identical to the PS2 games, as far as I remember- they\\'ve aged wonderfully). However, when the other characters are in control, this becomes something of a clumsy, forced platformer that left me longing for Sly\\'s stealthy, agile ways. That\\'s just my humble opinion- others may enjoy the segments of Sly\\'s friends and the attempts to instill gameplay diversity, but I was always anxious to return to the thieving raccoon. And in the defense of the developer, controlling Sly\\'s friends has always been a part of the experience, even with the original \"Thievius Raccoonus\".'][u'The inclusion of Vita functionality (Cross Buy) with this title makes it pretty enticing for any Sony gamer (especially at $40). I\\'m a fan of the PS2 Sly Coopers (\"Thievius Racoonus\" still being my favorite), and I have not been disappointed with \"Thieves in Time\" (and there are still TONS of collectibles in these worlds calling out to me), so I can wholeheartedly recommend it to those who are in the same boat.

Also, once all treasures in each level are collected, the arcade opens allowing you to play minigames that are slightly more advanced versions of the various ones found throughout the rest of the game. Safes are also back along with secret bottles (again, no idea why the third game removed these) and each safe has a very cool and useful item inside. That's all I'll say about that.", "Concerning the graphics, I was stunned at how beautiful they look on the Vita's OLED screen. Not only are the environments themselves sparkling, but the backgrounds are also quite astonishing.", "As far as gameplay goes, the world is much more free-roaming rather than linear. Of course, each quest requires you to go to a certain location and steal keys, reach a destination without being spotted, or any of the other various tasks that are required of you, but because there are so many collectables (including the addition of Sly Masks which will require a lot of searching or luck to locate them all) keeps you playing for even longer.

You have to go through a certain learning curve, invest hours in learning, but once you are through, you will be fully rewarded by the flexibility of the program and its nearly endless possibilities. A good way to learn is to buy Adobe\\'s book \"Premiere Pro classroom in a book\", which is essentially a sequence of hands-on lessons which walk you through different features of the program using an extensive set of tutorial movies which come on a disk enclosed with the book.', u\"I've been using this program for a couple of months, and had very positive experience. The program is very stable, has a logical and convenient interface, can render edits in real time, and allows to make as sophisticated edits as one can imagine. In fact, I cannot think about a single feature which is not included in Premiere. One can capture videos from a DV camcorder from Premiere, edit them in any way, add transitions, analyze the color balance of the movie, correct contrast, brightness, color balance, mix or record sound (5.1 surround can be edited, but a plugin to encode it in dolby digital format is included as a demo version only, one has to buy a full version for extra money; with regular stereo sound there are no problems), and export the edited footage in a variety of formats for DVD or internet. There is an extensive selection of audio and video filters and plugins, a title generator, and a means to generate effects such as split screen, moving logos, etc.\", u'Adobe has a 30-day trial version of Premiere on its web site. The difference between the full and the trial version is that the trial version does not include Media Encoder (i.e.'][u', the edited file can be saved only as AVI or exported back to a DV tape) and, I think, has some limitations in audio editing. I highly recommend everyone shopping for a video editor to download the trial version, get a good book on Premiere, and make an educated decision on how good this program is.', u'I also tried several other products, such as Sony Vegas and Ulead Video Studio. Vegas, in my opinion, has less capabilities (e.g., does not support multiple/embedded timelines (sequences)), has somewhat counterintuitive interface (which for instance applies to what happens when you left-click or right-click somewhere in the timeline - although at first glance its user interface appears to be more friendly), and is much slower on the rendering/encoding stage. Ulead is infamous for its instability (see Amazon reviews); in my case, it crashed 15 seconds after I started the program, after which I decided that I better try something else. In contrast, Premiere has been very stable and did not crash a single time on me.', u'In my opinion, it is the best product on the consumer market in the price range under a thousand dollars, and I can highly recommend it to those who look for a high-end video editor with a wide range of capabilities. (Of course, a very basic editing can be done even with Windows Movie Maker, which comes free with Windows XP).', u'Note that Adobe Video Collection, which includes Premiere, Encore, Audition, and After Effects, is a full video editing suite which offers much more for almost the same money than the Premiere alone.', u'Premiere Pro is available only for Windows, Mac is no longer supported.']", ["\n  I'm fairly computer literate, and bought this software following a friend's recommendation.", "I did so about a month after buying my first camcorder, a DV one to be precise. So I think you can take it as read that I knew pretty much nothing going into this - hey, I like flashing the cash!", "To be brutally honest, when I first got started with PremierPro I found it pretty daunting, given the sheer volume of possibility it conveys. After a few tips from my friend however I began to experiment once I'd mastered the basics.", "I tell you now - if you have a DV camera and make home movies, BUY THIS SOFTWARE!! Never again will your relatives & friends yawn at the bad shots, poor sound quality, bare monotony and dullness of the usual family video.", "This software makes me look like I know what I'm doing. I made the mistake when I first used my new camera by making use of the cool effects on it, but realised quickly that there was no need, because I could simply add them later with PremierPro.", "To those above who mentioned having difficulty using this, put the manual aside and just experiment! Drag & drop and right-click your way to editting heaven.", "I strongly recommend this product to anyone interested in making home movies, not just the Danny Boyles of this world (who used this software to make 28 Days Later!).\n"], ["\n  I was surprised to read that a few reviewers had trouble learning this software.", "It is true that the user guide is a 330-page monster that serves better as a reference than a tutorial, but with just a little experimentation, I discovered many advanced tricks and put them to use in my first sequence. I was able to create a 14-minute sequence with voice and music-over effects, including 80 individual scenes, and completed this project within six hours of installing the software without any previous experience with the product.", "I found the software to be quite intuitive and I'm enjoying learning a bit more with each project. The most challenging part of learning Premiere Pro 7.0 has been managing the export options, which is not covered in great detail in the user guide. The difference, however, is huge. My project was 3 gigs as a movie and only 120 megs as a MPEG-1 VCD. My computer had trouble handling the larger file, but did fine with the MPEG.", "Be sure that your system is sufficiently powerful to handle the software (the minimums stated may be too low for many functions).
