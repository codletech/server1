Number one, you always run the risk that unwarranted transactions will be made if your credit card information is stored on your X-Box 360 system.

If you order X-Box Live through your system, it'll renew every time your subscription runs out. This wouldn't be a problem except that it's not that easy to cancel. Instead of canceling through your system, you have to go through the hassle of actually calling X-Box Live support. Even then, depending on the representative you get, you may be hassled to keep your subscription because they really don't want you to cancel it. I'm guessing that's part of their job to convince you to keep it, but it still is frustrating to the person that is trying to cancel it.\", u\"You'll have to go through this process every time you want to cancel if you don't use a prepaid card.

You won't be sorry.\", u\"UPDATE: (3/6/2011): I updated this review about a year ago pointing out that you could disable the subscription on X-Box Live's website. As of this update, they've taken that feature away again. I'm guessing Microsoft must have seen a major increase on people who canceled their subscription, thus now forcing you to call their customer service hot-line again to cancel.\"][u\" Even if they add it back, just save yourself the hassle and get a prepaid card. You never have to worry about dealing with customer service that will try their hardest to get you to stay on as a recurring customer. Amazon also gives great deals throughout the year.

It\\'s been a Broadway play and there have been several adaptations of it in movies and TV.  I was generally familiar with the story but this was the first time I actually read the book.  Wow!  I was completely blown away!  This is the story of a two lonely and alienated men who work as farm laborers, drifting from job to job in California.  Lennie is gentle giant, physically strong but mentally retarded.  George guides and protects Lennie but also depends on him for companionship.  Together, they have a dream to someday buy a little farm where they can grow crops and raise rabbits and live happily ever after. This, of course, is not to be as the title suggests.  \"The best laid plans of mice and men\" is a line in a poem by Robert Burns, which describes how a field mouse\\'s world is destroyed by a plow.', u\"Steinbeck's narrative voice is seemingly simple in his descriptions of nature of as well as the details of the bunkhouse.  His characterizations of the people are magnificent.  We meet the other workers, all loners, and appreciate the beauty of the unique friendship between Lennie and George.  We meet Candy, the old man who is outliving his usefulness.  We meet Crooks,  the black stable hand, shunned by the men and therefore turning to books for  companionship.  We meet the cruel Curley who taunts Lennie into a fight.  And we meet Curley's wife, another lonely soul who uses her femininity to get the wrong kind of attention.\", u\"There's tension in every word and I found myself holding my breath, knowing that something awful would happen, my eyes glued to the page, the world of Lennie and George deeply etched into my consciousness.  I was pulled right into the story, wanting to shout warnings as I saw the inevitable consequences.\"][u\" The ending was incredibly sad, but yet satisfying. It couldn't have ended any other way.

I give it my highest recommendation.\"]", ["\n  \"Of Mice and Men\" by John Steinbeck remains properly on the reading lists of high school students because of the regional imagery through succinct dialogue. Unlike \"Grapes of Wrath,\" Steinbeck brings us swiftly into each moment, never letting us linger too long before walking us to the next place.", "The American Dream has many variations, but always, it is about independence and the pride of being one's own man. Lennie and George want this independence more than most men, but have less than most men to get there. In their case, it isn't a white picket fence, but a farm where they can raise rabbits.", "Lennie is not a bright man. He desires to care for someone and to be loved, but is unable to think past his own fear. George tries to protect him, but he too, although smarter than Lennie, is managed by his insecurity and foolishness.", "The story surrounds Lennie and George's efforts to get and retain work on ranch near Soledad, and more so, toward their American Dream. The big picture is always with them, but it is the day-by-day difficulties they have with being outsiders. Their intrinsic inability to be free is sheer tragedy, as they both fail again and again to make the right decision.", "It's a lonely story about two men who hope more than they can think, who are destined by their misery never to enjoy true companionship and happiness.", "Few books are as thematically pure as \"Of Mice and Men,\" which follows Man's search for self and meaning carefully. It is harsh in language and image, and the abstract ideas might be too much for younger readers to comprehend, but any intelligent teen will gain from it where John Knowles' \"A Separate Peace\" and J.D. Salinger's \"The Catcher in the Rye\" leave off.", "I fully recommend \"Of Mice and Men\" by John Steinbeck.", "Anthony Trendl", "editor, HungarianBookstore.com\n"], "[u'I am a tenth grade student and I recently read \"Of Mice and Men\" for a school project. I thought it was an excellent book. I felt that the author, John Steinbeck, did a first class job with this novel. It portrayed the relationship between George and Lennie in a way that made you become very attached to the characters. You wanted to read more to find out if they ever accomplished their goals and to see if their dreams became a reality. George and Lennie are complete opposites; George is a small, quick intelligent man, while Lennie is a man of huge dimensions but has the brain of a child. Throughout the story Lennie acts in ways that infuriate George, but George will always be there for his friend because he knows Lennie needs him to survive.  Lennie can buck barley like no one else because of his pure strength, but would probably starve to death if he didn\\'t have George to provide his daily meals. I think that has to do with why this book has been banned in the past by schools across the country. Some people may be offended by how the mentally challenged person is shown in this story. It seems as though the view being expressed is that people with mental problems can\\'t do anything for themselves. They are also a constant threat to others because they cannot control themselves. Lennie didn\\'t realize what he was doing was wrong until it had gone too far. These are stereotypes of mentally retarded people that some people may believe are reinforced by this novel. They are lead to believe that this book is discriminatory towards the mentally challenged. Parents whom believed this did not want their children reading this book because they did not want them to be exposed to these types of ideas. Also, Curly\\'s wife does not fit the traditional mould.'][u\" She is unhappy with her marriage and is not completely loyal to her husband like a conventional wife should be. She is always flirting with the men that work on the farm. Some adults believed that this was unacceptable behavior to expose to children. I don't think that a school today would even consider banning this book because cultural standards have changed greatly from when this book was first published in 1937. I also don't believe that this book should have ever been banned. It is a great book that takes you on an emotional roller coaster. Once you get started it is almost impossible to put down. The ending is also written to perfection. It is unpredictable and is incredibly moving.

Lola Kidd writes the cutest stories, ever and this one is no exception! Surrendering to the Stag is Book Six and latest edition to Lola's captivating Mail Order Brides Series and each release seems to get even sweeter! This series and its characters have truly captured my heart! I love it! This is a stand alone novella with no cliffhanger and a very happy ending. Although I personally don't believe it's absolutely necessary to read the five previous books, it would be most enjoyable and will certainly enrich your reading experience by helping to become familiar with Sunset Falls and its residents. These stories are sweet, enchanting, uplifting, humorous, and oh so romantic! The dialogue is smart and well written and flows beautifully. The characters are engaging, endearing, absolutely captivating and at times, laugh out loud funny. Lola does a remarkable job of crafting these elements into a happy and wonderfully entertaining paranormal romance. Each of these stories is set in a town named Sunset Falls so as the series progresses, we become more and more familiar with not only the town but also the residents. With each new release, it feels more and more like reading about our own friends and family. Stag shifter Clint Preacher has owned his own hardware store for fifteen years and is still the best handyman in Sunset Falls. He dreams of the day he could start a family. It seems all his friends have gotten a head start, courtesy of Olivia Grey at Lovely and Kind Brides, a mail order bride agency for shifters. There had been a rash of weddings lately. Five members of the Lunar Pack had found mates the month before and even had a group wedding.\"][u\" Like most of the single men in town, he has also signed up with L&K Brides after seeing so many of the men in town find mates but he hasn't been matched yet. Sunset Falls is finally beginning to see a turn around and it was all thanks to L&K Brides and Owen Brook's idea to get the town back on National Shifters Magazine's list of the best small town in America. Sunset Falls had been on it once, many years ago, but sadly the town had declined. Clint thought it would have taken five years at least to make it back onto the list but it had been only eight months and Owen had already received a reply from the magazine requesting a visit to their town in a month. They still had a lot of work to do. Up until now, he has supported the effort from the sidelines but he has an idea of how he can help so he needs to get busy. Besides, he has nothing better to do. It's been months and still no match from L&K. If only he could be as lucky as Dom and Gwen. They were both residents of Sunset Falls and had known each for years. Olivia Grey with L&K had miraculously managed to finally get them together. If only his match could be Rachel Drummond from the Two Wolves Cafe. He's had his eye on her since she graduated high school and has been flirting with her for years but she doesn't seem interested in him at all. He can never even muster enough courage to ask her out but he and his stag are both taken with her and her curvy body. As far as he knew, she's not even dated a single guy in the last twenty years and he's kept a watchful eye on her for all twenty. He has dreams of being matched with the beautiful human woman but that's all it is, just a silly dream. Or is it? Hmm...Rachel Drummond works hard at the Two Wolves Cafe but she never takes time off for a vacation much less taking time for dating, a relationship or a family. But that doesn't mean she doesn't want it. All her friends had signed up for L&K Brides and a lot of them have already found matches including both her bosses, Matt and Mark Lunar. Even handsome Clint Preacher, owner of the local hardware store has signed up and he's just the sweetest and most handsome guy ever. Maybe her friends are right; maybe it is time for her to give L&K a try. She would love to have someone special with whom she could share her life but it would certainly take an extra special man to accept her and her unusual problem. She's always kept it a secret but it's the reason she's never tried to have a relationship. What man would ever want her? If only it could be Clint but he would never want her if he knew the truth. Or would he? Hmm...Get ready and cue the music....It's time for Olivia Grey to work her magic - again! Handsome studly stag shifter-check! Beautiful curvaceous human waitress-check! Heated attraction, sweet romance, humor and a wee bit of angst-you bet. I can't resist. I just have to share my favorite line in the story.

Charlene has knocked it out of the park - again with her latest release, Rosebud, Part One of her tantalizing Awakened by the Vampire Prince Serial! Yes, I said serial so that means multiple books with , dare I say it, cliffhangers so be forewarned. Yikes! Although it's not necessary, I would highly recommend reading Charlene's Chosen by the Vampire Kings, Stolen by the Alpha Wolf and Unlikely Mates Series since many of the characters are also included in each. I think that's one of the things that I truly enjoy most about Charlene's books. The premise and the characters for each book are so well developed and carried forward throughout each series. The familiarity of the characters makes it so easy and enjoyable to immediately fall comfortably into each story. Her characters are always my favorite part of each of her series. They are always captivating, engaging, laugh out loud funny and sexy. Va..Va..Voom! Of course, the story is always exciting, thrilling, funny, exceptionally well written, romantic, arousing and oh so seductive. Charlene skillfully combines these elements to craft a delightfully entertaining paranormal offering filled with humor, adventure, suspense and lots of romance. Prince Xavier and Princess Esral have been dancing around each other for months. The problem is, they've been dancing to different tunes. Fortunately for us, I think their playlists are about to be synced! Yowza! We first met Princess Esral when she was introduced in Book Four of Charlotte's first series, Chosen by the Vampire Kings and man, did she arrive with a bang! Her father, Elven King Katar, gave her as his most prized possession to the vampire kings, Zane and Brant, as a token of peace between the elven and the vampires. What?\"][u\" She was to be mated with one of the kings as a sign of good faith and to broker a truce between the species. Oops! They both already have a mate - the same woman, their Queen Tanya! Esral was to be mated to royalty so that only left Brant's brother, Prince Xavier, but he refused to mate with the elven princess. Oh my! How disappointing! But Princess Esral decides to remains with the vampires and with Tanya's help, she finally receives permission from her father to choose her own mate. The only problem is, she wants the one vampire male that doesn't want her - Xavier. Oh, what a cluster-fest! I bet you thought I meant to say something else, didn't you? Esral has just received word that her father is very ill and may be dying. She must return home to Pulamor. If her father dies, her brother, Prince Keton, will become king and for some reason he hates vampires so that means the fragile relationship between the two species will be destroyed. Yikes! A union between the two races is imperative. Oh my glory! Upon her return, she's criticized, ridiculed and rejected by her own people. They think she's defective because she's still unmated; apparently, not even a vampire will have her. And to make matters even worse, her brother's evil girlfriend, Cheri, is spreading nasty rumors about her. Oh no! She had to find a way to salvage the situation to alleviate her father's shame. What's a princess to do? Try to seduce a mate, of course! But will it be Xavier? Or her other guard, sweet York? Or her once intended, nasty Zafar? What's really wrong with her father? And just what in the world is the evil, manipulative, low-born, former server Cheri up to? I don't know. We'll just have to read the book to find out. So get ready my lovelies! Here we go again and there will be fireworks! No spoilers from me but I will say this... Beautiful elven princess whose thorn is still unbroken-check! Handsome, sexy vampire prince whose too stubborn to admit he's in love-check! Drama, suspense, humor, angst, heated attraction and steamy dreamy romance-you bet! I just can't help myself. I have to share my favorite passage in the book - 'Much to her horror, she moaned loudly as his gentle touch caused a zing of pleasure to pulse through her. Her flower blossomed and filled with nectar'. Come on you guys, you have to admit that's not only original but pretty cute as well! After all, Esral is an Elf.

The book is brilliant, short and simple. I have to admit that while I got the book to get better at teaching, I did end up learning and understanding things that I had taken for granted myself. Better late than never :) If imaginary numbers, exponential functions, the natural log and radians ever bothered you, this book will make it all come together.

Kate's initial thoughts of Asher come back to life as their meeting goes from good to 'just kill me now' in a little bit of time.

The author encourages the suffering saint to see that Jesus Christ was the ultimate suffering servant and that  our temporal afflictions are sent from God to cause us to rely on Christ  and promote obedience, sobriety, righteousness and godliness.

Sam Harris has produced a brief monograph on the issue that manages to distill the key issues without creating an impenetrable density for the reader to slog through.\", u\"For those who think value is found in a dollars-to-words ratio, the thinness and focus of this volume might not seem like a bargain, but I loved having a book with something important to say that I actually READ.  I'm not saying that all subject matter must be reduced to tweets, but I know that, for example, as fascinated as I am by the topic of moral improvement that Stephen Pinker covers in \", u', I am never going to read more than 600 pages just on that subject.  There are simply too many other things I also care about.  So Harris has done people like me a real favor by thinking about free will and pulling together the relevant evidence for his position, and expressing his ideas with his trademark wit and clarity in a work that can be digested in an hour or less.', u\"For those who read about free will in other books and publications, there's nothing very new here.  In fact, given the choice between recommending this book and something else, depending on the person I was talking with, I might instead suggest Cris Evatt's \", u'.'][u\"  Cris has no credentials and the book is a collection of essays and quotes from various sources rather than a single, cohesive argument, but it makes one of the strongest cumulative cases for determinism in a short work that I've seen.\", u'The one thing that did surprise me is the positive blurb on the book jacket from Owen Flanagan, whose ', u' is a stunning case for compatabilism, whereas Harris writes, \"Compatabilists have produced a vast literature in an effort to finesse [moral complications from determinism].  More than in any other area of academic philosophy, the result resembles theology.  (I suspect this is not an accident.  The effort has been primarily one of not allowing the laws of nature to strip us of a cherished illusion.)\"  And again: \"Compatibilism amounts to nothing more than an assertion of the following creed: A puppet is free as long as he loves his strings.\"  What Harris (convincingly, in my view) makes a case for is quite different from the case that Flanagan makes, so I think it is to Flanagan\\'s credit that he nevertheless endorses Harris\\'s work.', u'Daniel Dennett comes in for some well-deserved (but well-modulated) criticism in \"Free Will\" for the sort of epistemological shell-game he employs in an effort to rescue some \"elbow room\" for a brand of free will.  I noted earlier that it was the argument of a theologian friend that made me realize that free will is impossible, but that\\'s not quite complete.  It was that argument in addition to the utter failure of Dennett\\'s ', u\" to convince me that anything like a free will worth having could possible exist that drained the last corpuscle of my delusion from my mind.  There's nothing like a failed argument, by friend or foe, to make you consider the plausible correctness of the opposite position.  The weaknesses I discerned in Dennett's case are precisely the ones Harris goes after, and in brief, intelligent prose dispatches them with an effectiveness and efficiency few authors could manage.\", u'Harris states that the existence of an immaterial soul does nothing to rescue the notion of libertarian free will.  This is certainly correct, although I have heard the argument made many times as a trope that \"free will is not possible if humans don\\'t have a spirit or soul.\"  Because the issue is causality in general and not merely physical causality, whether a cause is purely physical, like a cue ball hitting an eight ball (or an electron firing in a neuron), or can be thought of in immaterial terms, like an idea inspiring a poem, makes no difference.  Everything, physical or otherwise, is either the result of prior conditions, or if not, is random.  Souls change none of that.', u\"So theists who try to argue that without a god, humans have no free will are wrong.  That simply doesn't matter.  And perhaps the most disturbing implication of some points in Harris's argument is that if a god did exist, in all likelihood it wouldn't have libertarian free will, either.  If you struggled with some of the absurdities inherent in our existence before, a deep appreciation of our condition vis-a-vis determinism will push you so far down the rabbit hole you might just find yourself reading much longer, more profound, denser works in some effort to get your bearings.  And in the end it is probable that the best you'll be able to muster is simple agreement with what Harris says in this slim volume.\"]", "[u'Free Will by Sam Harris', u'\"Free Will\" is the persuasive essay that makes the compelling case that free will is an illusion.  Free will is intuitively understood but a difficult concept to master.  Dr. Harris systematically, and with few precise words destroys the notion of the concept of free will.  With a degree in philosophy and a doctorate degree in neuroscience and the innate ability to convey difficult concepts to the layperson, Dr. Harris is best suited to enlighten us on such a challenging topic.  This 96-page book is composed of the following eight chapters:  1. The Unconscious Origins of the Will, 2. Changing the Subject, 3. Cause and Effect, 4. Choices, Efforts, Intentions, 5. Might the Truth Be Bad for Us?, 6. Moral Responsibility, 7. Politics, and 8. Conclusion.', u'Positives:', u'1. Fascinating topic in the hands of a great thinker.', u'2. Profound without being unintelligible.  Elegant and accessible prose.', u'3. Does a great job of dissecting free will.  The author systematically beaks down the concept of free will by attacking it from various angles.', u'4. More so than his previous great essay \"Lying\" he makes more use of his scientific background.  He relays studies that support his arguments.', u'5. The illusion of being in control is a concept that Dr. Harris masterfully destroys.', u'6. The author differentiates voluntary and involuntary actions.', u'7. Great quotes, \"Our sense of free will results from a failure to understand this: We do not know what we intend to do until the intention itself arises\".', u'8. A discussion on the three main philosophical approaches: determinism, libertarianism, and compatibilism.', u'9. Great examples that help the reader comprehend the challenging concept of free will.', u'10.'][u' Classic Harris eloquence, \"How can we be `free\\' as conscious agents if everything that we consciously intend is caused by events in our brains that we do not intend and of which we are entirely unaware? We can\\'t\".', u'11. Does quantum mechanics provide a foothold for free will?  Find out.', u'12. Does the process of conscious deliberation provide a foundation for free will?  Find out.', u'13. Do we really control our minds?  Once again, the mastery of Dr. Harris continues.', u'14. The implications of not having a free will. Great points!', u'15. A fascinating discussion on the level of responsibility.', u'16. How does a retributive judicial system fit in all this?', u'17. Free will within a religious framework.', u'18. Free will and politics.', u'19. A final chapter that brings everything together.', u'20. Links worked great on the Kindle.', u'21. Brief, powerful essay that can be read multiple times.', u'Negatives:', u'1. My only discomfort with the essay is the casual use of the term soul.  I understand that Dr. Harris does not accept the soul as an empirical concept and may have used the term as a metaphor (equating it to the brain in one instance) but I prefer leaving out all supernatural terms unless properly defined.', u\"2. Some topics are introduced briefly and leave you wanting more, isn't that always the case with Dr. Harris?\", u\"3. Having to wait for Dr. Harris's next intellectual contribution.\", u\"In summary, what makes this essay great is that the more you read the more you get out of it.  It's a profound essay that is easy to follow but is hard to master.  It is so rewarding to read interesting topics from great minds.  This essay is the ultimate appetizer, delicious and with an everlasting aftertaste.  Free will is not an easy concept to understand but a worthwhile pursuit to endeavor and Dr. Harris makes the journey a fulfilling one.  I can't recommend this brief book enough, highly recommended.\", u'Further suggestions: \"', u'\" by the same author, \"', u'\" by Michael S.

Another sweet treat from Harmony Raines! Bound To Her Bear is the first novella in her delicious new Bear Bluff Clan Series and she has delivered another winner! The story is deliciously cute, delectably sweet, completely captivating and seriously sexy. The dialogue is well written and flows well. The characters are captivating, engaging and lovable. Eirik McCormac is the newest and youngest member of the Bear Bluff Clan Council. He has been appointed to the position of Holder of the Deeds, or more commonly known as treasurer by his Uncle Stuart McCormac, alpha of the clan. His father previously held the office but had recently died leaving the clan in quite a dangerous predicament. His father, Wayne McCormac, had signed over the deed to their sacred lands at Garrow's Creek to Carson Frasier of the Bear Creek Clan causing quite the scandal. Carson had claimed he was Wayne's eldest son by a female bear from Bear Creek and by law the  deeds should be passed to him. Fortunately, Carson's claim had been disproved through DNA evidence and the sacred lands returned to Bear Bluff.  Although the matter has since been resolved and Carson actually had no legal claim to the land, his father's memory had still been tarnished and his judgement on all clan matters had been called into question.  His poor mother had been hearten and shaken by his father's actions. He now lived with the shame of his father's actions along with the ache in his heart to find his true mate yet he wondered if any woman could ever accept him with the shame he bore. Drew Stanton had lived in Bear Bluff her entire life and had all but lost hope of ever finding her true mate.  After her mother's death, her dad had seem to give up on life completely. He began drinking heavily which eventually led to him losing his job.\"][u\" Almost overnight, she became the sole bread winner and primary care giver for her dad. Maybe it was for the best that she had never found her true mate. What man would ever want her? She had always been attracted to Eirik McCormac and in school they had even been friends but now he didn't even speak to her. He probably thought she wasn't good enough for him. They weren't true mates so why would he want to be friends with her. He no longer knew she existed. Or did he? Hmm.....Maybe the mistress of fate just hasn't had enough time to work her magic. Oh my!

Heartache, angst, heated attraction, fiery passion, sweet romance, a true mate surprise and some steamy dreamy sex-you bet!

Then it showed up in the Also-Boughts of a book I wrote. I'm already a plotter, but currently working on bulking up my own outlining process and reading TONS of outlining/scriptwriting books, so I had to pick it up. I was not disappointed!\", u'Here are some of the insights I gained from this book:', u'- How to put character arc first -', u\"My go-to bible for outlining is Story Engineering by Larry Brooks, but he admittedly focuses a lot on plot points. I was trying to figure out how to overlay character arc onto his 4-box story architecture and coming up short. Characterization has always been a struggle for me, so this isn't a huge surprise.\", u'Libbie\\'s section on character arc helped connect a lot of the dots for me, and was well worth 10x the price of the book alone. Oddly enough, I have the book she mentions multiple times\\u2014The Anatomy of Story by John Truby\\u2014and was skim-reading it just before I read this book! BUT I did not pick out the character arc information I needed from that (maybe an argument against skim-reading?). Libbie\\'s focus on character arc was exactly what I needed to make things \"click.\" She explained her version of it simply and concisely. I now want to go back to John Truby\\'s explanation and see if I understand it.', u'- Antagonists and Allies -', u\"I had really never heard of an Ally before and this is a key insight that Libbie's book talks about in detail. They way she explains allies is *really* easy to understand.\"][u\" I immediately figured out several of my protagonist's allies in this outline I'm working on. Once you know your allies, a lot of scenes just before the resolution fall into place. Cool stuff!\", u'- The Character Flaw -', u\"Libbie's character arc revolves around one simple idea\\u2014that the character has a deep flaw that determines both the internal and external conflict for the entire book. She provides examples from Lolita and Charlotte's Web to drive this point home\\u2014and again, a lot of pieces clicked into place for me.\", u'In other books, the character flaw is talked about in vague or wishy-washy terms. It\\'s \"inner demons\" or \"internal conflict,\" which has historically shed very little insight on characterization for me. No more! I\\'m confident that my characterization will improve leaps and bounds just by understanding the character flaw and how it plays out in the character arc.', u'- Theme as a filter -', u\"Most storytelling books relegate theme to the bottom of the heap, focusing primarily on plot or characterization. Libbie gives theme a prominent place and suggests using it as a filter for what makes it into your book. I again found this extremely helpful in the same way I found the character arc section helpful\\u2014I'm trying to map concepts of theme, character, and so on onto the 4-box story architecture. Libbie didn't go into a ton of detail about theme, but no bother\\u2014there are other books that explain it in detail. This one idea was easily worth the price of admission alone and again, connected several dots for me.\", u'- Plotting multi-protagonist books -', u\"Libbie's ideas about plotting for multiple protagonists reaffirmed a lot of what I already sensed but hadn't quite been able to put into practice. She provides easy-to-understand examples from her own work and confirmed that every character needs its own arc plotted. She also confirmed that sometimes your protagonists will be each other's antagonists\\u2014and that this is a good thing, helpful in unifying the book rather than telling stories in parallel. All in all, a fantastic discussion on multiple protagonists that most story craft books either completely skip over or only briefly mention.\", u\"Overall, Libbie has a ton of great insight and lots of NEW ideas about outlining that make this book insanely valuable. That's why I gave it 5 stars.\", u'BUT, I would caution that the book belongs on the shelf and isn\\'t a one-stop shop on craft. I say that because, while I think Libbie agrees that writers should read other books on the subject, she makes it really easy to understand and think, \"yeah, I got a handle on all of this.\" She\\'s like one of those fantastic professors in college who makes you feel so smart and makes the material so fun that you decide not to study too hard for the final. Then, you get a 77% and you\\'re like, \"What? I thought I understood this!\"', u\"While Libbie's method is easy-to-understand, I still recommend attempting to map it onto the traditional three-act structure as homework. I did this last night (I used the 4-box structure provided in Story Engineering) and it was not nearly as easy or straightforward as I thought it would be. However, the exercise is a big reason for the connected dots I keep mentioning. There were so many freaking a-ha moments\\u2014I was basically in heaven when it all fell into place.\", u'In doing that, I also realized I had new questions that I need to explore on my own. For example:', u'- Can an ally be a thing or idea, rather than a person? An antagonist can often be an antagonistic force instead of a person\\u2014the person is usually a symbol of the force. I believe the answer to the question is probable \"yes.\"', u\"- Should the antagonist be introduced as late as Libbie suggests? Other architectures seem to introduce or at least mention the antagonist earlier. Libbie does point out that the antagonist can be a character who essentially becomes antagonistic at that specific point in the outline\\u2026 however, I'm still a bit unsure of what would work for me, and need to keep digging for that connective tissue to my personal style.\", u'The second thing I recommend as homework is to dig into scene structure a bit more. Libbie has a section on pacing, and while easy to understand, I sense that many writers will benefit from the more formal study of scenes and sequels to see where these simpler explanations come from. I think Randy Ingermanson (the Snowflake Method) has several articles on this topic if you want to get your feet wet.', u'So, I guess this is all my long-winded way of saying that I believe this book is fantastic for both beginners who find most story craft books a bit daunting and confusing (as I did when I first started and still do at times), AND writers with several books under their belts who are focusing on something specific to improve (like theme, or character arc, or pacing).', u\"BUT don't skip the fundamentals completely. Do the optional reading Libbie suggests to understand the theory behind many of her insightful conclusions. Some of the books I'm enjoying right now are Story Engineering, The Anatomy of a Story (Libbie's suggested book), and  Story by Robert McKee. This text greatly enriches my understanding of these other meatier and more complex story craft books\\u2014but I wouldn't consider it a replacement. And based on Libbie's candor within the book, I don't think she intended it to be.\"]", ["\n  A friend of mine who read this book the same day I did said, \"It's so rare to come upon a book that changes your writing process at this point. I wasn't expecting this.\" I'm quoting her because she said it better first. :) This book changed not only my process but my understanding of a number of aspects of storytelling. I could almost hear the clicks in my head as things that I had kind-of-sort-of-maybe grasped before dropped solidly into place.", "Typically my outlines, though complete (in that they cover all the way from the beginning to the end), are a good five manuscript drafts away from being a solid-enough story to send to my editor, because my outlines have, up till now, been about what happens in the story (\"this, then that, but then, so they\"). When I've planned out a story, I've typically put a character in a situation, then worked it all out from there.", "Take Off Your Pants approaches it from an entirely different direction, and that approach just...literally unlocked \"story\" for me. I now have three storyline outlines for a current project that are SOLID, and if I do happen to get stuck during the writing of it, I now know how to solve the problem and get the story going again. ~In the first draft.~", "I don't know that my first drafts will go any faster than they usually do (something Libbie promises in the book), but I can definitely see a time-and-effort savings in subsequent drafts, which I now expect I'll be editing mainly for prose rather than structure and character.", "This book may have been the best investment I've made for my writing career\u2014at $2.99 it was a complete steal.\n"], ["\n  I wasn't halfway through before I realized it was going to make most of the books in my writer's library obsolete.", "By the end of it, she made me realize just how completely wrong I've been doing things and forced me to change almost everything that I've been planning for the rest of the year.", "In a good way.", "I cannot recommend this book highly enough.\ufeff\n"]], "rating_change": "", "video": "", "current_price": "", "count_customer_reviews": "", "previous_price": "", "image": ["http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EbAFy4AZL._SS30_.jpg"], "category_path": "Kindle Store / Kindle Short Reads / Two hours or more (65-100 pages) / Self-Help"}

Little tidbits of important information that other, more elaborate books may or may not mention: Getting at the course too late, so you can't warm up, are all flustered, and duff the first hole. Wasting your energy carting a golf bag around that is too heavy with unnecessary equipment, too many balls, jackets, etc. (For people playing in colder climates!) Not regripping your clubs. I'd played golf for many years, before I even realized one has to change their grips now and then! Tinkering with your swing. Now that's really important: every time I have a bad shot, I think it must be my swing and change it. Bad, very bad.", "Mr. Scarff discusses all these features, and many more, in a funny, humorous manner. I really liked \"Why You Suck at Golf\" and learned a lot from reading it.

This is the best golf swing book I have ever read for the high-handicapper who is looking to bring consistency to his/her swing. This book is not about fades, draws, varying trajectory, or anything else that involves advanced shot-making. But for the beginner, it's clear, common-sense, easy to follow and easy to learn. Info is presented in a way where you can actually learn and build upon the different parts of the swing. Muscle memory is key, along with a sound mental approach. It's all covered here.

I'd hit the ball OK some days, but usually I always put too much pressure on my short game to score.  I read all the books, took all the lessons and beat balls on the range until my hands bled.  Mechanically everything always looked copasetic, but yet I was never consistent in ball striking.  Thin, fat, toe, hook, push, etc.\", u'I knew it was important to be in a relaxed and \"athletic position\" at address.  My inherent problem was with excess tension THROUGHOUT the swing.  I mistook power for the \"coiling of the spring\", (bad metaphor!).  At the top of my backswing my arms, shoulders and torso were tied in one big connected KNOT.  Like most men I thought muscle strength was the key to distance and I would try to over power everything without knowing it.  Think Vijay Singh, Fred Couples, Ernie Els.  Swing easy, hit hard.', u\"So I took to the range after reading this book with yet another tip to experiment on like I've been doing on and off almost all my life; low and behold, once I relaxed my arms and shoulders throughout the swing and hit the ball in a much more free flowing fashion, I swear to God I felt like the incarnation of Ben Hogan.  Solid, straight shots like never before.  Feeling the ball compress against the face of the club each time was sublime.  Working it right and left at will.\", u\"I'm now regularly shooting in the seventies from the pro tees and focusing more on the short game to start beating old man par.  I may even start competing in some amateur events next year.  The key is ZERO TENSION in all muscles throught the swing.  Tension destroys the golf swing.\"][u'  Let the club swing itself.  As Sam Snead said, \"Feel oily\".', u'The reason a good teaching pro could never help me is because they could not \"feel\" what I was feeling at the top of my swing.  Thanks Michael McT.

I poured through it in a night to search  for the secret cure and I found it.  I can't believe it took me 18 years of  golf to discover this book. This really should be in every beginner's bag,  to get his or her mechanics and fundamentals together, as well as any long  time golfer who occasionally 'loses' it. It's quite a testament to its  staying power to note that there are no reviews of less than five stars for  this wonderful manual [my rating will be no different].  Hogan boils down  the game to one important aspect, striking the ball. Grip, stance, setup,  back swing, downswing are all meticulously verbally described, and then  highlighted by amazingly detailed and accurate drawings. Written as a  series of SI articles in the 50's, the teaching voice has lost none of its  punch over the ensuing years.  The gods are in the details, and I noted  immediately in the setup section things I was doing to hinder the  chain-reaction of his preferred swing. Left foot out a quarter turn, hmm,  that's new but makes sense, elbows at hipbone at address, and arms very  close to chest to allow the right elbow to fold properly.  That's what I  needed. His description and the images of the glass / back swing /  downswing plane will provide appropriate visual clues during practice.  I  found his discussion of the waggle and supination of left hand on follow  through also quite interesting. I've purchased copies of this for my  long-time golfer mother and my girlfriend who's just taking up the game,  hopefully they'll enjoy it as much as I did, and we can discuss Hogan's  straightforward instruction with a common background understanding.\n"], ["\n  Forget all the other gimmicks you see on television infomercials; the  super drivers, wedges, trouble clubs, fairway woods, videos, swing  trainers, etc. Also, don't pay any attention to the lessons presented  monthly in the two leading golf magazines. They're often in conflict with  each other and give you too many things to think about during the swing. If  you really want to improve your golf, buy this book.", "Written by one of  golf's greatest players and clearest thinkers on the mechanics of the golf  swing, this book will, in simple and concise language and wonderfully  detailed drawings, improve your game. My belief is, someone who has trouble  breaking 100 will be able to get to 90 in short order. Anyone who shoots  bogey golf (90) will be able to work him or herself into the low 80's. And  if you're like me, in the 7 to 10 handicap range, the book presents a  number checks on the grip, stance, and swing plane so that if your game  does occasionally go awry, you'll soon be back in the groove. Mr. Hogan was  correct. Anyone who is reasonably coordinated and applies the principles  detailed in this book, should be able to build a repeating swing and break  80 on a consistant basis.", "I had to smile as I read some of the other  reviews of this book. Like many of the other reviewers, I too have had to  repurchase this book a number of times because of the difficulty in getting  the book back from those I've loaned it to. Other than getting a lesson  from a top flight teaching pro, this book will do more to improve your game  than anything else that's on the market.\n"], ["\n  As a kid I took a few lessons from a top notch instructor, and I always found it helpful to think back and swing the way he taught me.

This book was a godsend.", "Hogan doesn't just tell you what to do, he explains why.  He shows how to make the basic REPEATING swing that can be used with ALL clubs, driver through PW.  This makes the game so simple.  You can use this book to quickly learn the correct swing, and confidently hit a good shot every time because you know you are doing it the right way.  This lets you think less and less about swinging mechanics and more and more about strategy, and the game becomes immensely more pleasurable.", "Put this book and a 9 iron by your bedstand, practice as you read it, and you will find youurself hitting with more confidence and consistency after the first chapter.\n"]], "rating_change": "", "video": "", "current_price": "", "count_customer_reviews": "", "previous_price": "", "image": ["http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Yz9Ns5IBL._SS30_.jpg"], "category_path": "Kindle Store / Kindle Short Reads / Two hours or more (65-100 pages) / Sports & Outdoors"}

Fortunately, McPherson soon soothed my misgivings. After a somewhat dry synopsis of Lincoln's early life, McPherson briefly and with great insight touches on each and every key facet of Lincoln's career. He addressed the debates with Stephen Douglas, Lincoln's election and subsequent efforts to prevent secession, his role in the war, his relationship with his cabinet, his personal and official views on slavery and emancipation, and his attempts to negotiate a peace with the Confederacy.", "In every chapter, McPherson's admiration for our sixteenth president shines through, even when discussing Lincoln's questionable suspension of habeas corpus. I found this part especially interesting in light of recent events. The Bush administration used the same arguments that Lincoln put forth to justify its suspension of civil liberties. One could argue that, justifiably or not, Lincoln opened a Pandora's Box that subsequent less-scrupulous presidents have taken advantage of.", "I have read a great deal about this period in history and yet, on a page-for-page basis, there are few books that can shed as much insight into the heart and mind of our greatest president.

I have many critical remarks about the execution and the message, but I love it nonetheless.\", u\"It hit me straight into my heart. I start with some complaints, but they don't define the book's worth. As usual, I finish my review with what I liked and what has spoken to me.\", u'I found the voice of this book a bit too decisive. It\\'s obvious that life without goals serves the author, but like with Goal Suck by Matt Stone I found the anti-goal crusade a bit too fanatical. However, at the beginning of the book he writes: \"I don\\'t won\\'t you to believe anything that I say. I don\\'t want you to believe anything anyone else says either. (...) This is nothing more a curated set of my experiences.\"', u'Very rarely I found such statements in a self-help literature. Jim Rohn was saying similar things. With such a disclaimer I can study the material with an open mind.', u'So, sometimes Mr. Yoder sounds like teaching a dogma in a church, like when saying that I won\\'t improve much by using an app to track my progress. He ditched tracking along with goal settings. I don\\'t think goal setting is the ultimate solution too (putting it mildly; goals get on my nerves, but I found tracking to be a foundation of my progress. Maybe because I\\'m not \"legendary\" yet? ;)', u\"And goal settings works for some. I and he are not able to make it work for us, but it doesn't matter that others are also limited in such a way. Jim Rohn was a big fan of goals and I don't consider myself wiser than him.\", u\"The part of shipping art fast was a bit ironical, considering that I found a few mistakes in the book. Well, I'm sure the author will take care of them and I agree that it's better to provide imperfect book that no book at all.\"][u' Even with those mistakes the book is extraordinary.', u\"A theme of this book is minimalism and focus on just one thing. This is not for me. My interests are wide. I would have felt crippled if I would have had to pass on some things that I'm passionate about. Maybe I'm just wrong, who knows? Yoder is not the first person telling me that I should be laser-focused. But I'm passionate about life and progress, not speed reading or time management or any other single thing.\", u'I got an impression that Stop Goal Setting was directed to beginners, those who are eluded by goals, but the voice of the book doesn\\'t reflect that intention. I have negative experience regarding goals and positive experience with letting go. I live on purpose. I am able to absorb the message of this book. But the \"I\" who I was 3 years ago? I don\\'t think so. It all sound a bit too mystical, too intangible and the constant claims that \"stay with me and it will get more clear\" could be annoying.', u'For example the question he advise to ask yourself all the time. The question is great. But an average person has no training or willpower to control her thoughts for an extended period of time. It takes a ton of practice before such person is actually able to implement this advice.', u'I really think that for someone without relevant experience this book may sound like bollocks. Such a person could get some glimpses of what an author wanted to say, but not the whole picture.', u'The author is a grizzled veteran and it shows. There is no place for patting on the back and to mask the hard truth. No BS. Short sentences, short chapters. Bare essential driving the point home.', u\"BTW, I've read this book within two days during my commute. It's short. It's an advantage. You'll find no fluff here.\", u\"All above remarks are just tiny bits of dissatisfaction. I devoured the book. I love it. It hit me like a ton of bricks.

I find him somewhere between Guy Kawasaki and Jeff Goins when it comes to conveying his message. His writing opens veins, stir emotions, grabs your attention and makes you to start taking action.\", u\"I wholeheartedly agree with him- when you find your purpose, you know what to do. You always know. It's just the matter of asking questions and following the answers. Three years ago I had no idea why have I lived. I have also been avoiding any attempts of self-analysis. Nonetheless, following such internal guidance in several months I found my path, my personal mission statement. That brought me to the higher level. I could then take action. Ship work. Attract people. I was nobody 3 years ago. I've just sent an email to 500 of my readers. 30 of them were nice enough to reply within 10 hours and give me a feedback. It all happened because of discovering my purpose.\", u'It really works better for me than goal setting.', u'JD Yoder is very quotable. I highlighted almost every page of Stop Goal Setting. A few sentences that grabbed my attention:', u'When you feel entitled to something you sit and wait.', u'Your wants will take care of themselves.', u'You cap your future in the moment you attempt to predict it.']", ["\n  I admit that this type of book is one of my favorite genres--I have read many books along this line.  This one, however, got my attention immediately for a couple of reasons--the title and relatively short length of the book.  The book is so clear and concise--the content seemed deceptively simple yet the ideas resonated with me and will continue to resonate for some time.

To describe the impact and influence of that willingness, that first notion that conventional morality might not be the best guide to  success, would be as impossible a task as trying to summarize the influence of Galileo. Napoleon  is rumored to have written extensive annotations to this book; Stalin allegedly kept a copy on his nightstand. Half of Shakespeare\\'s villains (Iago, Richard III, etc.) derive their character in whole or part from this text.', u\"Most of this book is extraordinarily controversial, even today, yet still fundamentally difficult to argue against; there's a reason the Catholic Church kept it on the _Index Librorum Prohibitorum_ for centuries. If you're looking for food for thought, it's here.\", u'This particular kindle edition is fairly good; the text is cleanly presented with few typographical or scanning errors, and the translator has clearly made a significant effort to present the text as accurately as possible in a modern translation, with several footnotes detailing possible alternate translations of particular words, etc.'][u' In addition to the text of _The Prince_, this edition also includes two shorter historical works by Machiavelli, \"Descriptions of the Methods Adopted by the Duke Valentino When Murdering Vitellozzo Vitelli, Oliverotto da Fermo, the Signor Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina Orsini,\" and  \"The Life of Castruccio Castracani of Lucca.\" (\"Duke Valentino\" is an alternate name for Cesare Borgia). Both additional texts are, in essence, case studies of how contemporary historical figures achieved success by acting according to the precepts which Machiavelli outlines in the main body of the text, and as such are very useful and interesting companion reads.', u'As a final note, if anyone has recommendations for histories of Italy in this time period, please link me to them in a comment -- after reading this, I want to read more about the era. Thanks!']", "[u'There are two good reasons to read Machiavelli\\'s classic, \"The Prince.\"', u'First, so you\\'ll know what everyone is referring to when  you come across the adjective \"machiavellian\" in news stories or  other media.  This adjective has become so commonplace (and overused) it is  almost a cliche.  Also, most who use it have never read this letter from  Machiavelli, a Rennaisance courtier to his Prince (written from prison),  but they insist on peppering writings with this noun turned adjective so  much that as a matter of clearly understanding what is meant by the term,  famiality with this brief treatise is helpful.', u\"Second, this book does  describe most (not all) power situations very well.  From politics to  corporations to most settings where advancement, influence and control  exist, Machiavelli's observations and rules apply.\", u\"You will also discover  that Machiavelli was not as evil as he is understood to be in popular  thought.  What he was doing was describing the rules of the game that have  existed and always will exist for many situations involving selfish humans  in competition.  Machiavelli's rules are neither good nor bad in themselves  -- they describe a process.  What is good or bad is how those who master  Machiavelli's rules use their power and position, in a society that tempers  actions according to law and basic Judeo-Christian principals.  When those  principals do not exist (as in Nazi Germany, the Middle Ages or under  Communism, or by those who refuse to live by these constraints),  Machiavelli's rules take on their demonic and evil cloak; usually because  they serve demonic and evil ends.  In societies where positive constraints  exist, for example the U.S. political system, Machiavellian behavior can  produce excellent results.\"][u'  A good example involves Abraham Lincoln, whose  ambition led him to use every legitimate trick and stragety to master (and  remove) political opponents.  His mastery of Machiavellian behavior  constrained by the US political system allowed him to save the Union and  end slavery.', u'To fully appreciate the modern lessons that can be taken  from this writing, one must translate Medieval sensibilites to their  contemporary counterparts.  The casual way in which Machiavelli discusses  the need to kill opponents was necessary to those who wished to be princes  500 years ago.  Today, of course, \"killing\" is translated as  rendering less powerful, or taking an opponent out of the game.', u\"What does  one get from this book?  It is a roadmap with insights and lessons about  how to 1) get ahead of others to attain power; and 2) maintain and expand  one's power in the face of others who would usurp one who is in a desirable  position.\", u'This book is about ruthlessness and putting the attainment of  goals ahead of any other consideration.  Plenty of maxims that are also  tossed about frequently in media are to be found in Machiavelli\\'s book:  \"the end justifies the means,\" \"it is better to be feared  than loved,\" \"if you fight the prince, kill the prince\" to  name a few.', u'It is essential reading to anyone who would be in a  competitive environment and hope to advance, if for no other reason than  many of one\\'s competitors operate by Machiavelli\\'s dictums (which arise out  of human instinct and selfishness).  One does not have to operate according  to Machaivelli\\'s code -- many examples of alturism and \"pluck and  luck\" exist to defeat any claim that Machiavelli\\'s road map is  essential for success.  However, human nature and human history deliver far  more examples of ruthless self-interest (Machiavellianism) behind success  in power situations.', u'Is Machiavellianism bad?  Not in and of itself.  Remember, one must translate the Middle Age ethos to current practices --  there usually isn\\'t blood spilled as a result of today\\'s Machiavellian  duels, just power and positon.  Most political and business leaders are at  least partly Machiavellian.  The trick is using one\\'s power to good ends.  Thus, even though Lincoln and all of our presidents were Machiavellian in  their climb to  the White House, some of them did darn good work there.  The same is true for business leaders.  Jack Welch (GE), Bill Gates  (Microsoft), anyone who advances past the first few rungs of the corporate  ladder or dominates markets at the expense of competitors is using  Machiavelli\\'s dictums.  The trick of a just and good society is to set the  bounds by which power can be attained and exercised so that good and  benefits will flow from those who are able to \"claw their way to the  top.\"', u'To summarize, read this book if you want to 1) truly  understand when the adjective \"Machiavelli\" is used to describe  people and 2) understand the rules by which most people navigate their way  to power.']"], "rating_change": "", "video": "", "current_price": "", "count_customer_reviews": "", "previous_price": "", "image": ["http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41doi3GSgwL._SS30_.jpg"], "category_path": "Kindle Store / Kindle Short Reads / Two hours or more (65-100 pages) / Business & Money"}

So, all you'll ever see from me is a five-star or a one-star (since no stars isn't a rating, unfortunately).\", u'I rated this book  WORTHY!', u\"Emmeline Pankhurst was a radical political agitator for women's suffrage and women's rights. She founded the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) which actually established a jujutsu-trained all-female squad of bodyguards to protect her from police assaults. This graphic novel, for one price but in three parts, takes that and runs with it.<.p>\", u'Drawn very much in the old-style of the golden era of comic books, the illustrations are evocative, well-done and rather nostalgic which makes them engagingly appropriate for the subject matter. Emmeline Pankhurst was a wild and crazy girl, and this captures that and the spirit she represented very much.', u'The comic is very short, only 24 pages total, which makes for a fast read, but of course for those who buy the story, there are two more episodes to come included in the original purchase price (as I understand it).'][u\" One issue I took with it is that it suggests that the bodyguards were trained in Bartitsu, but this was not the case since that very personal art, invented by Edward William Barton-Wright (who is, as far as I can see, is depicted as the trainer and who was very nearly the same age as Pankhurst), largely went out of style in 1902. This is the art featured in a Sherlock Holmes story and named (or misnamed) 'Baritsu'. Suggesting it this way is actually an insult to the real trainer of the WSPU bodyguards, which was a woman named Edith Margaret Garrud. Why she was snubbed in favor of a guy in what is otherwise a strongly feminist novel, I don't know other than that the author is a proponent of Bartitsu!\", u'The novel is set in 1914 and this too, is problematic because the WSPU ceased operations during World War One for the sake of national unity against the German threat to sovereignty and freedom. The war began in late July 1914, so the events depicted here could have taken place in the earlier part of that year, I suppose!', u\"A charming variety of characters are included, some fictional, others not. Persephone Wright is a fictional woman of ill-repute, a \\u201cfallen woman\\u201d. Flossie Le Mar is an homage to Florence LeMar, who actually was a practitioner of jujutsu. Katharina Brumbach really was a wrestler and strong-woman. Toupie Lowther was also a real person, an avid motorist, and a practitioner of jujutsu. Judith Lee appears to be an invention of writer Richard Marsh. Kitty Marshall, a fictional quick-witted teenager and a Miss Sanderson a violent fictional character. It's doubtful this group (fictional or otherwise!) ever met.\", u'That aside, I really liked this novel and I recommend it. Issue one features the Amazons\\u2019 conflicts with the London and Glasgow police and is out as of the date of this review. Issue two follows a month later and covers \"a daring rescue mission in the Austrian Alps\" (over which Toupie Lowther actually rode on a motorcycle). issue three comes out a month after that and depicts the Amazons trying to prevent a terrorist attack. Is it this that will precipitate World War One?!

For any martial arts fan, jitsu is usually the ending phrase for some japanese martial arts. Little did I know that the Sufra- beginning stood for suffrage until I really began reading the book. The cover look really interesting to me as well because it has a English woman taking down a man. Did Suffrajitsu pass my expectations?

There are things you may think won\\u2019t work, but try changing the order of keywords (nouns and verbs) and keep trying until you find out what works! Adjectives have an effect on the scope of things with Alexa (so words like more, louder, etc. are used), but getting them added into the request with your subject and verb also has a syntax that works and one that doesn\\'t, maybe more than one that doesn\\'t. If you know something\\'s supposed to work and it\\'s not, then maybe you should take that 25 word \"say it\" opportunity to let Alexa know how you speak. We all know that those call centers in Mumbai claim to speak English, and yet we all have a hard time understanding them; my point is to make sure you don\\'t sound like one of those call center agents to Alexa. If you have dentures, put them in if you want Alexa to know it\\'s you. Don\\'t give up, I can tell Alexa has been enriched beyond what\\'s documented, and the possibilities with Alexa are expanding all the time. Already you can tell Alexa to turn out connected lights. Before long you should be able to tell Alexa to print that shopping list, though even now the client software has copies of the dialog with Alexa so anything can be printed. Also while I mention that free client software, each request of Alexa becomes a \"card\" in a sequential list you can review, and Alexa is helped if you go through the card list and tell her she did well, or not.'][u' Also Alexa can keep music lists and voice differences straight between husband and wife users by establishing a free profile for each user. You will find there\\'s a right way to tell Alexa to change profiles from your wife\\'s to yours, and to ask her which profile she\\'s on. In those profiles your wife and you can have separate music lists to play, shopping lists, etc. You can also tweak the news differently, you can hear what blew up overnight and financial news, and your wife can keep up with what Bruce Jenner and family are doing now. In short if you don\\'t love Alexa, then let the romance begin because the possibilities look endless to me and I\\'m retired from 30 years at IBM and another 10 at AOL, and I\\'m impressed with Alexa. This is one of the goodies entrepreneur Steve Case dreamed could come from the Internet, the problem is he got too fixated on a TV screen built into your refrigerator door.  While Jeff Bezos was dreaming sweet dreams of Alexa Steve Case went out and bought Time-Warner and half of Maui, Jeff Bezos can buy Steve Case, so I\\'m betting with Jeff. Alexa is a lot out of the box right now, but Alexa is a promise of a fast ride into the next decade where Echo\\'s will be ubiquitous. Just imagine an Echo in Safeway that can tell you where the Quinoa (/\\'ki\\'nw\\'\\'/ is? By the way, if your Echo is nearby you can ask Alexa to \"define ubiquitous.

Abrams got a lot of refreshingly candid quotes and anecdotes--most of which were new to me--from staffers, guests, network executives, and other insiders.  Then he gracefully assembled them into a tale that\u2019s never been told before but should have been. Reading his work was like reuniting with old friends--Hi, Hal!--to reminisce about our loopy adventures in Late-Night Land. I recommend this book to any fan of comedy.", "I\u2019m only quoted in Abrams\u2019s book a few times. That\u2019s mostly because, as I told him, I had already related several of my \"Late Night\" anecdotes in my own book, \"Comedy Writing for Late-Night TV,\" also available on Amazon: http://amzn.to/1rGwqhZ. My book is the only one ever written about how to turn out the comedy that Abrams\u2019s book describes us \"Late Night\" writers as having labored over. It\u2019s the same kind of comedy you still see on the current late-night shows, which is a measure of Dave\u2019s far-reaching influence.\n"], "[u'With David Letterman\\'s retirement approaching sometime next year, it\\'s to be expected that there\\'ll be new books cashing in on his career. Brian Abrams\\' is the first out the gate, and it\\'s a nice surprise that it\\'s not one of those flash-in-the-pan knock-offs. Instead, this is a comprehensive inside history of Dave\\'s \"Late Night\" show on NBC as told by those who wrote and produced it, as well as by network executives who had their own relatively more-distant but equally important perspectives.', u'Abrams has provided a seamless narrative solely by allowing the participants  to speak for themselves. Oral histories are a tough nut, as they depend on enough witnesses to construct a story. In this effort, Abrams has succeeded: We can follow Dave\\'s career from L.A. in the late-\\'70s to his move to CBS in \\'93 through the collective memories of those Abrams has persuaded into telling their tales. Among the more significant voices are Merrill Markoe\\'s and Steve O\\'Donnell\\'s, who both -- via the words from others -- receive their due recognition for both molding \"Late Night\" into a manageable and enduring classic as well as surviving the stress and headaches associated with preparing an hour-long program four nights a week.', u'There\\'s the wonderful \"Rashomon\"-like origins of the Top Ten list, as one memory conflicts with another but the underlying foundation rings constant. There\\'s the unflinching testimony of Barry Sand\\'s tenure there. There are the numerous details of how particular bits were conceived and realized, like the Suit of Velcro and the 360-degree hour, all from those who came up with these then-revolutionary ideas in the first place. Above all, there\\'s the sense glimpsed from all the testimony on how Dave approached his job.', u'Is this book definitive?'][u\" Probably not; there are voices missing, like Gerard Mulligan, Chris Elliott, Barbara Gaines, Jude Brennan, Rick Scheckman, and a few others whose close associations with Dave's shows span four decades. While unfortunate, their absences don't detract from the overall picture Abrams has managed to provide. And Andy Breckman offers perhaps the most sage advice near the end that every writer should heed.\", u'There are a few minor nits: Tom Snyder\\'s studio was, as I recall, on the second floor at 30 Rock, not where Dave\\'s morning show and \"Late Night\" were broadcast. The section titled \"Index\" isn\\'t really an index but instead appendices. There are no acknowledgements. Abrams was gracious enough to mention me in his opening chapter, but I feel it didn\\'t really belong there: This is a story about the show, not one viewer\\'s obsession with it.', u'But none of this should deter anyone from gaining invaluable insights into \"Late Night\\'s\" remarkable run. Abrams has established a high bar for subsequent writers to reach, and we\\'ll all benefit from the challenge.']", ["\n  I admit that I haven't read many oral histories and would not have imagined that such a format could relay this much of a compelling and coherent story, especially over a span of 13 years;despite the \"1982-93\" in the title, the story actually begins in 1979-80 when Letterman was first starting out at the Comedy Store in L.A.", "It's interesting to see human sides to a NYC writers room for television.

Russia).', u'For reasons known only to himself, Snowden didn\\'t take advantage of the \"Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act, 1998 and make his complaints about what he regarded as the NSA\\'s illegal data collection activities to the Office of the Inspector General, and ultimately to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees; he didn\\'t resign his position and join an advocacy group like ACLU or the Electronic Frontier Foundation; he didn\\'t leak one or two documents to a newspaper to make his point. He stole 1.7 million classified documents, to cause the maximum amount of damage. He wasn\\'t out to repair a system but to bring it down.', u'As Lucas puts it:', u'\"The quite unnecessary damage caused by Snowden makes it hard to believe that his aim was solely to expose wrong doing. It looks far more likely he was trying to cripple the NSA and it\\'s allies, and to hurt America\\'s standing in the world.

He strips away the fig leaves of \"whistle-blowing\" and \"privacy\" and shows that Snowden's actions have caused incalculable damage to the intelligence services of the \"The Five\": US, Canada, UK, Australia, and New Zealand.

Actually, understanding Politics without understanding the principles in this text is an impossibility. A person who does not understand the principles of this text is too naive to understand why their leaders do what they do. Politics occurs in business, family life, and other settings, as well as government; Machiavelli's rules may be applied in all of these. Though living by these rules isn't necessary, a successful politician must act with mindfulness of their implications, or face failure. Considering the far reaching implications of Machiavelli's thought, one might wonder why elementary school children do not study \"the Prince.\"", " Many people don't have the guts to face what Machiavelli says. He presents the rules of 'hardball' politics; the only time that he mentions morality is when he describes the occasions in which a leader may need to fake it. Politicians have become so adept in following these rules that those whom they lead will often take offense at the suggestion that their leaders live by them.

But, deeply, it will force any serious reader to take stock of the lengths neccessary to attain great power. Lives are flited at like pieces on a chess board with absolutely no uneccessary concern (if they can't hurt ya, screw 'em). Why, aside from that whole learning about world domination thing, this book is such a neccessary read for anybody with a stake in daily life is because this is the book your leaders sleep with under their pillow. There hasn't been an intelligent, powerful, and influential political leader that hasn't been influenced by Machiavelli and this book. It's very important to really wrap yourself around reality in reading this book so as to open your own eyes to what people do to lead (not just dictators, facists, and imperialists, but deomcrats and republicans.).

Harmony Raines has hit another homerun with Doctor Bear, the second novella in her Bear Bluff Series. The books in this series are are all stand alone stories and have their very own happy ever after endings and NO cliffhangers, The story is sweet, enticing, romantic, arousing and sensual. The dialogue is well written and flows effortlessly. The characters always take center stage in Ms Raines stories and Doctor Bear is no exception. The characters are captivating, engaging and oh so sexy. Raines expertly combines these elements into a delightfully entertaining and deliciously cute paranormal romance. Handsome, hunky, bear shifter Dr Ben Hansom is the heart throb of Bear Bluff. All the ladies love him and all of them want him - not just as their doctor, but in their bed. Oh my! Even with every single woman in Bear Bluff falling at his feet, Dr Ben hasn't found a single one that interests him. Nope, he and his bear long for the day when he will find his true mate. His longing for his mate and family has grown even stronger now that his good friend Eirik McCormac found his mate, Drew. He has almost given up hope but never fear, fate hasn't given up on Dr Ben. Ben has been called to the hospital to deliver Freyja McCormac's baby and is stunned to discover that the new nurse at the hospital, currently taking care of Freyja, is his mate. What? But even more surprising is the fact that she's human. Nurse Beth Andrews came to Bear Bluff after having her heart broken at a doctor from her previous job. All she wants is to be left alone to start a new life and there will be no more men for her! Nope, not going to happen! Or so she thought - because she set eyes on the handsome Dr Hansom, her heart started hammering out  a Zumba rythmn in her chest.\"][u\" So much for well laid plans because hers just went up in smoke. But we all know that life is never easy especially when you have a jealous young receptionist pursuing Dr Hansom and an arrogant, deceitful ex-boyfriend sneaking into Beth's bed - naked and without being invited. What the heck? Can Ben convince Beth to give him a chance to win her heart? Will Beth be able to accept Ben's bear? I guess you'll have to read the book and find out. I absolutely loved it! Handsome bear shifter doctor-check! Beautiful, curvy, virgin nurse-check! Sweet romance, heartbreaking angst and some steamy dreamy sex-you bet! That and a whole lot more! Five fabulicious stars!

Women flock to sexy Ben, Because he is gorgeous, but he only has eyes for his newfound mate. One woman has her sites on Ben, and tries her best to make trouble for them, but not for long.

This is the day after the alien invasion or Tarrick invasion of her life. Tarrick her alien hunk fantasy come true, only she didn't like the that he thought he could be her 'master'. Cat has given in to her desire for Tarrick... Hot Alien Hunk in leather... Who wouldn't.\", u\"But we find her listening to the Warriors trying to figure out the Earth station's wiped data. All the while she is gathering information. She was no victim she was a survivor. On asking Cat to help them... She flipped them the bird... Making it clear that she refuses to help them. She is still mad because the women were held hostage.\", u\"As human Cat doesn't understand  the logic of the Latharian race, they see the earth women as just a treasure to be claimed, no harm should come over them but they also thought that these women had no intelligence, couldn't to any 'warrior' tasks.

The point is, as in reality Mina points out that as much as there are bad out there, you can face even worse.

What a wicked web she weaves! Chloe Hawke has woven a delightfully wicked web of forbidden romance, intrigue and suspense! Stepbrother Wants is the eighth book in the powerful new series, His Twisted Games by Chloe Hawk. This is a fantastic read but please be aware, this is a serial so be forewarned, it has multiple installments and nail biting cliffhangers but it also means that it's perfect for a quick lunch break read. And if you have Kindle Unlimited, it's all gravy! Personally I love serials but I recognize they may not be everyone's cup of tea. The story is intense, dark, exciting, thrilling, compelling, erotic, romantic, sensual and sexy. The dialogue is smart, raw, well written and flows smoothly. The characters are powerful, captivating, engaging and intriguing. Hawkes skillfully combines these elements into a decadently sinful and wonderfully entertaining romance. Hawks has really opened the throttle to wide open with the suspense and intrigue cresting at a fevered pitch, kicked up the heat to a fiery blaze and it is smoking hot!

My only issue with this author is her failure to provide her readers with any information or links to subscribe to notifications announcing the release of a new installment of the book. It is both inconvenient and time consuming to continuously search in hopes of finding a new installment. I am following this author on Amazon but to date, I have not received any emails announcing a release. I enjoy this series and would like to continue reading more from this author but it is inconsiderate for Hawk to expect loyalty from her readers when no effort is made on her part to accommodate our convenience. Although this in no way detracts from the contents of this story, it does influence my decision on whether I will read any successive books written by Hawk. None the less, it is still fantastic entertainment and an awesome read!

While talking off air she encouraged me to check out the C-Factor, a nifty little surprise under her belt that was cheaper than a can of soda in a vending machine, and downloaded right to my kindle reader app on my smart phone. Its a short and easy read that I refer to on my way to work every day, as a reminder of these principles. Whats neat about it is that it cost less than a candy bar yet it is a neat little set of characteristics to add to your persona that will change the rest of your life. I encourage to support Linda and download this book!", "To hear the interview I did with her on my show, follow this link:[...]\n"], ["\n  Great For guys like me who don't have tools to talk to women.\n"]], "rating_change": "", "video": "", "current_price": "", "count_customer_reviews": "", "previous_price": "", "image": ["http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tv5XJeQ-L._SS30_.jpg"], "category_path": "Kindle Store / Kindle Short Reads / 15 minutes (1-11 pages) / Self-Help"}

(January 1, 2012)", "item_model_number": "", "reviews": ["[u'By coincidence I read Ruth Bader Ginsburg\\'s elegant and restrained autobiographical talk on the week end of the 40th anniversary of Title IX, the amendment which in 1972 provided that no person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance, and also on the very day that the NY Times published an article (\"Elite Women Put a New Spin on an old debate Over Balancing Work and Family\". 6/22/12) that describes Anne-Marie Slaughter\\'s  painful decision to leave her high profile job at the State Department to better attend to her family (see her article in Atlantic Monthly, \"Why Women can\\'t Have it All\", July/August 2012) This was the spirit in which I read the Ginsburg talk.', u'  Ginsburg describes her world in the 1950s. She was 1 of 9 women in the entire Harvard law school freshman class; \"The most prestigious clerkships were not open to women\"; no US attorneys were willing to hire women as criminal prosecutors (yet Legal Aid- where lawyers were less well paid- \"was full of women\" because the role of defense lawyer and defendant was thought to be more suitable for women). But Justice Ginsburg was not only brilliant (of this she says nothing), she also had a lot else going for her. She had the perfect supportive spouse. She could afford child support and gave birth to her daughter at the start of her career when she was still young.  Further, as a law student, to some degree her hours were flexible. After her clerkship, she eventually landed a job in teaching at Rutgers, which she liked. There she could \"be her own boss\" and, teaching allowed her the luxury of doing whatever interested her.'][u' Gradually her \"own consciousness (of sex discrimination) was awakened.\"', u' In reading this story, it is clear why Ginsburg \"could have it all\" and, sadly, why many working -women today cannot. In her Atlantic Monthly article, Anne Marie Slaughter concludes: These \"mundane\" issues--the need to travel constantly to succeed, the conflicts between school schedules and work schedules, the insistence that work be done in the office--cannot be solved by exhortations to close the ambition gap. I would hope to see commencement speeches that finger America\\'s social and business policies, rather than women\\'s level of ambition, in explaining the dearth of women at the top. But changing these policies requires much more than speeches. It means fighting the mundane battles--every day, every year--in individual workplaces, in legislatures, and in the media.', u' Thus, though in her talk, Justice Ginsburg shows us how far the USA has come, we are painfully aware of how far we have yet to go - will the November elections set us further back? In her admirably composed, restrained way, Ginsburg explains why the Equal Rights Amendment has not succeeded: \"Any human rights guarantee that is phrased in grand, general terms is vulnerable. . . . \" Finally she concludes \"Without the ERA, the controversy will drag on as case by case is reviewed, ideally by legislators, but if they default, then by judges, it will take a long time, But I am confident the equality advocates will emerge as the winners.\"  If so, she will have done her part.']", ["\n  Lynn Gilbert is the most unusual of interviewers.

That\\'s just what this graphic novel edition does.  In 50 illustrated pages, this graphic novel captures the main points from Goldsmith\\'s original book.  Told in story fashion, each of the 20 habits is covered with just enough to teach you why you should break these habits to become even more successful.  It\\'s fun to read and teaches some important concepts.', u'Previously, I\\'d read these Round Table and Smarter Comics after I\\'d read the original book, and the graphic novel versions were great, quick, reviews to cover the main concepts in an illustrated fashion, and I liked the review.  This time, I read the graphic novel version of \"What Got You Here Won\\'t Get You There\" first.  I liked the short, simple lessons, but it also made me want to read the book that this comic was based on to get the longer version too.', u\"The illustrations were done by Shane Clester, who I liked from previous graphic novels he's done, and I felt he did a great job with this one too.  His illustrations match the lessons and add to the learning you can do in this form.\", u'Even though this short book only touches on each of the 20 workplace habits you need to break, I feel if you think a little about each habit, how it applies to your situation, and if you need to work on improving yourself in this area, you can gain a lot in a short time.  However, it might take a bit more thinking on your part to figure out how to apply the simple lessons in your situation.'][u'  And this is good, thinking about how to actually act upon the lessons will help you learn even more.  Also, while the book suggests these are habits you should break in the workplace to be more successful, the lessons can be applied outside the workplace in your personal life too.  Breaking them in your personal life can help you be more successful in your home and personal life.', u\"Bottom line, if you liked the original book, you'll enjoy this quick review of the principles in illustrated format.  If you like graphic novels that contain self-help lessons, you'll like this one.  If you apply these lessons, you'll undoubtedly find yourself becoming even more successful.\", u'Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of the \"Tough Guy Wisdom\" series and others.']", "[u'I thoroughly enjoyed reading the comic book version of Marshall Goldsnith\\'s book entitled What Got You Here Won\\'t Get You There. This comic is an abbreviated version of Marshall Goldsmith\\'s bestselling book of the same title, wherein he identifies 20 workplace habits that organizational leaders need to break. These unuseful habits are equally apparent within many family environments--there is personal as well as professional value in heeding his advice. The illustrations make it easy and breezy to digest the profound ideas presented. Whether in the workplace or in the family, leaders need to work on regulating their \"automatic\" urges that serve little value or add negative results to the environment. Increasing one\\'s ability to self-regulate and moving into more thoughtful, reflective responses offers the leadership team more bang for their buck. The 20 workplace habits to break are identified in a playful manner, but, according to Coach Goldsmith, it is serious business to consider  replacing the identified \"success breakers\" with more productive ones. Goldsmith discusses many potential pitfalls commonly apparent to him in leadership teams throughout the course of his prolific career doing corporate consultation work. For example, instead of clinging to the past (ie making excuses), bounce forward into a constantly evolving version of oneself. He emphasizes the down side of adding value (making it about \"me, me, me\" rather than about the organization), the import of stepping up and taking responsibity for one\\'s responses and that such an effort is not \"automatic and will require some discipline.\" Goldsmith implies (and I agree) that it will require considerable inner work to change habits that behave as if they were impulses.'][u' Underlying bad habits such as the \"sucking up\" mentioned by Goldsmith seems to me to be anxiety-related (oops, am I trying to \"add value?): the anxiety to be loved, appreciated and needed, whether at home or in the workplace is present within all of us. Working to change hardwired habits that reflect less teamplayer attitudes and more personal needs for approval or to be the \"best\" (win, win, win) takes a concentrated and disciplined effort over time. Dr. Goldsmith identifies serious problems in the behaviors of leaders at the top and then points the way toward mitigating these problems in order to achieve successful results for the organization.', u\"If you are looking for a quick way to get inside the head of one of the world's most successful leadership coaches, take a look inside this comic. You will be glad you did and probably will want to order multiple copies as gifts to your own leadership team! The comic is fun to read, is chock full of insight, and reflects the insightful thinking of one of the greatest business coaches of our time. Dr. Goldsmith rocks!\"]", ["\n  When climbing the ladder of leadership, we lose sight of how we're perceived by others.  This can cause us to be blind to habits that are received negatively and work against our goals.  Goldsmith explores 20 common habits that get in our way.

My other favorite thing about the book is that the first 30 or so pages do a great job of explaining the why and how of truly eating well. The information is clear and easy to follow. We bought this book for all of our friends and family for Christmas and I gave away a free copy on my blog.\n"], ["\n  This is now my go-to cookbook for just about every meal I make. I've tried the majority of the recipes and have not been disappointed with one of them.

Anyone can make them, and most of them are super fast and easy. It's amazing how good healthy food can taste! The Cashew Chicken Lettuce Wraps are a family favorite - my 13 year old, a very picky eater, begs me to make them all of the time, and my husband who is a typical meat-loving man devours them too. Other favorites of ours include the Blueberry Pumpkin Pancakes (although we usually use apple sauce instead of pumpkin, which he suggests on his website), the Berry Smoothie (my 2-year-old loves it, as well as the whole family), and the Chicken Salad. It would make a great gift for someone who is trying to get healthy, and it is also a wealth of information about nutrition - why certain foods are good or bad for you - another thing I loved about this cook book.

I use it to manage my portions better and reduce my carb intake. I also have learned a lot about what foods have carbs from this little booklet, I did not know that milk had carbs, that beans have carbs, that juice is a carb for instance. It has been very helpful in educating me about carbs and keeping me more on track with my portions.

As a Registered Dietitian, I have introduced SureCount to a few of my clients who want to improve their quality of life without being overwhelmed by all the nutrition information out there. They have LOVED it!! SureCount is educational and serves as a guide to help manage food intake, specifically carbohydrates. It explains how to stay within healthy carb limits so glucose levels can become regulated and diabetes can be better managed. It fits anywhere and goes anywhere! This is resourceful for everyone as it teaches about portion sizes, as well. Try it out!!\n"], ["\n  Since being diagnosed with Diabetes, I've struggled with knowing what and how much I should eat.  Surecount lays out exact serving sizes, and if you stick to it, it will transform your eating habits and make life so much easier.  There is nothing on the market as helpful as Surecount, and it's a must have for anyone dealing with Diabetes.

In a sense, \"From Hither to Yon\" would make a great Appendix to \"Alex and the Amazing Time Machine\", describing as it does Cohen\\'s intellectual journey through the possiblity of actually building a time machine that works. Appendices usually appear at the same time as the book, and usually at the end of the book, but perhaps Cohen has found a way to move the Appendix forward in time.', u\"Whatever the publication sequence, Cohen's journey is well told, with many humorous examples, and is well worth spending time reading and reflecting on the physics of time travel. This Kindle Single would have been greatly improved by a list of references cited in the text, and for the interested reader, here is such a list:\", u'Cohen relies heavily on Dr. Ronald Mallett, \"a genuinely accredited scientist at the University of Connecticut who believes he might well develop the first time machine, [who] has put it: \\'This century will be the century of time travel just as the twentieth century was the century of air and space travel.\\'\"B Bruce Henderson has written a more detailed description of Mallett\\'s work: Time Traveler: A Scientist\\'s Personal Mission to Make Time Travel a Reality.', u'Cohen describes two sets of scientists who analyze the possible effects of the Large Hadron Collider: the first set believe that the LHC is so dangerous that for the universe to survive, the LHC must fail. As Holger Bech Nielsen puts it: \"This particle is, let us say, extremely not nice.'][u'\" Nielsen\\'s theory is that \"the universe itself seems to be thwarting the creation of any new God particles.\" Holger Bech Nielsen', u'The second set of scientists believe we may find \"tiny tears in the fabric of space-time\" if the LHC ever actually works. Dr. Igor Volovich believes 2012 (when the LHC is scheduled to function) \"may come to be known as Year Zero in the age of Time Travel. It\\'s also the year that, according to Mayan prophecies and Hollywood studio executives, the world will end.\"', u'Cohen consulted J. Richard Gott who designed a time machine powered by huge cosmic strings spinning close to the speed of light; see Time Travel in Einstein\\'s Universe: The Physical Possibilities of Travel Through Time. He also consulted Paul Davies from Arizona State University who wrote How to Build a Time Machine, and Clfford Pickover who wrote, inter alia, Time: A Traveler\\'s Guide. Both indicate that \"if phenomena are not expressly forbidden, they are often eventually found to occur.\" Michio Kaku also echoes the thought in Physics of the Impossible: A Scientific Exploration into the World of Phasers, Force Fields, Teleportation, and Time Travel.', u'Most of Cohen\\'s sources rely on advances in technology and peculiarities of Einstein\\'s theory of relativity; in the forward of Paul J. Hanin\\'s Time Machines: Time Travel in Physics, Metaphysics, and Science Fiction, for example, Kip S. Thorne from CalTech writes: \"Time travel wasonce soley the province of science fiction writers.... One now finds scholarly analyses of time travel in serious scientific journals, written by eminent theoretical physicists...\"', u'Some of them, especially Mallett, were inspired by H.G. Wells\\'s The Time Machine (Dover Thrift Editions) which prefigured Einstein by several years. There are many good explanations of Einstein\\'s theory, of course, and Cohen provides an excellent example of his own. Hollywood used a technique suggested by the theory in \"Planet of the Apes\". Cohen is brilliant in describing why space satellites which are essential for our GPS devices must be programmed to take account of the theory to synchronize with the clocks in our cars, which run a tiny bit faster than the clocks on the satellites.', u'All great intellectual fun, Cohen writes, until Kurt Goedel appeared -- \"he was absolutely nuts\" -- lived near Einstein in Princeton, and looked for paradoxes in the relativity theory. His solutions showed that \"if the universe were spinning, travel to the past would be possible -- more than possible, commonplace.\" Carl Sagan turned to his friend Kip Thorne at Caltech for a mechanism to transport his character in Contact across the universe; Thorne came up with worm holes.', u'Cohen discusses two solutions to the paradoxes implicit in time travel: how can one go back in time without affecting the present? One solution: multiple universes: \"Time is a maze, a trap, a hall of mirrors and replicas.\"', u'Cohen concludes where he started, with Mallett and his efforts: \"I really do hope Ron Mallett is the first person to lick time. Something about his quest is so pure.\"', u\"Cohen's book is the story of his journey through time, one that I enjoyed immensely.\", u'Robert C. Ross', u'May 2012', u'Revised March 2015']", ["\n  Great writing that brings time travel and the underpinnings to laymans terms.

As a Marine Sniper during the Vietnam war he was the \"Go To\" man for the most incredible missions involving the use of a sniper rifle. His stories are legends in the Marine Corp and in the Riflemans\\' World as well.', u'He was unusual in that he carried out most of his missions alone..until the Corp made having a \"spotter\" with the sniper to verify the and record the kill shot. Their is still doubts about how this rule came in to play. Some believe that competitive snipers  (Army) simply did not believe Hathcock\\'s growing number of kills. The addition of a \"spotter\" also served as a safety measure while the sniper was focused on the target, the spotter would be able to maintain awareness of the surroundings.', u'Hathcock was terribly injured while hitching a ride on a n armored vehicle when it ran over a mine and caught fire. He received burns over most of his body while attempting to rescue other occupants of the vehicle. He underwent many months of treatment and long periods of therapy and was not fully recovered when he entered the 1000 yard marksmanship challenge. His scar tissue broke open from the sling while he was in the prone position but he just kept competing ignoring the pain. His clothing was soaked with blood when he finished his round.', u'He was known as \"White Feather\" his trademark which made him a wanted man with a bounty on his head by the NVA and VC.', u'The epilogue told by a Marine who wanted some advice on how to zero his scope was very interesting. A lengthy, time consuming process but once it was completed he would have a rifle that was accurate at any given yardage, under a number of weather conditions assuming the triggerman was calm and collected.'][u'  One wonders where Carlos learned the method?  Trial and error or from an expert?', u'Carlos Hathcock retired as a Chief Warrant Officer after 23 years in the Marine Corp. Many books have been written about him and about Snipers in general.  Hathcock ,in my opinion,changed the thinking from \"Sniping is an act of murder\" to \"Sniping is necessary to counter enemy sniper attacks, instill fear and disorganization in enemy groups, and eliminate key leadership in enemy ranks. \"', u'He proved this principle in his mission to kill the NVA general.', u'This was another winner from Author Burgess and I rate it 5 star', u'Reviewed By', u'Roger Shepherd', u'USN.

As an added bonus, there's a sort of a brief how-to on taking your weapon to the sniper level.  Not a true course, but a glimpse into the level of attention and method for just one aspect of their trade.  Do a little reading about glass bedding too.\n"], ["\n  Another page-turner in the sniper series, but perhaps \"page-turner\" is the wrong word.

And in the finest Hitchcock tradition, he's the kind of psychopath you can relate to.  You feel his pain from hearing his wife tell the same story so many times it drives him mad.  There may be two sides to every story, but Babcock cleverly only gives us one -- the husband's -- right up until the very end, when the wife finally, and unexpectedly, gets her say.\n"], ["\n  Read this entire story while sitting at a bar drinking a Guinness. As I approached the end, I literally laughed out loud and the guy next to me, watching the Packers peel the skin off some unworthy opponent, asked me what was so funny. I told him the guy in the story is a nut, but I feel his pain.", "Good story. Great subtle ending.\n"], ["\n  When I say this is a quick read I mean it's quick read.  Nonetheless I truly enjoyed the authors quick paced story telling. He gets right to the story and draws you in with the first couple lines. It is a darker kind of humor that I enjoy because the story feels real. The pain and frstration that the couple feels throughout the story jumps off the page and even makes you feel uncomfortable.

That was, honestly, rounding up a hair from something more like a 3.8 or 3.9.  The book was among the best indie stuff I\\'ve ever bought off of Amazon, and it was as good as your typical Baen book (which I read and enjoy!), but it wasn\\'t magical.  The first section, set in a prole slum on Earth was really evocative and well done, but when Act 2 began and the protagonist went into the military I found myself thinking \"eh - I\\'ve read this story before. Several times.\"', u'I did say in my review for Terms of Enlistment that I was looking forward to seeing what Marko delivered next.', u'I was thrilled with this story.', u'Just before reading it I read some other indie fare and the contrast couldn\\'t be more clear.  The other story I read was a first or second draft, and was written by someone who has not (yet) developed an ear for dialogue, description, or anything else.  Tons of \"as you know, Bob\" descriptions, purple prose, and more.', u\"Stepping into Marko's short story was a breath of fresh air.  The first sentence hooked me (and that's REALLY rare with indy stuff).  Marko has developed a lot as an author.  The dialogue was lean and tight, the pacing was perfect - there was not a single flaw.\", u'Now \"not a single flaw\" is good for 4-stars, but to hit 5 stars, a story has to do more than merely avoid mistakes: it has to actively do things right.  It has to create magic.  This story had lots of little touches that really developed a mood, made me care about the characters, made me feel that the characters are real.  The fact that the ship \"Lucky 13\" was named after a serial number and not a tale number, the fact that the pilot wouldn\\'t trade her even for a better one - lots of little things all worked together perfectly.'][u'Finally, the pacing of the story was dead on.  Just enough back story, steadily rising action and risk, and then the pay off at the end was exactly the right note.', u\"A lot of what's written in the military SF genre is in the 2 to 3 star range. 4 isn't uncommon.  5 is pretty rare.\", u'Joe Bob says \"check it out\".']", ["\n  I really enjoyed this tense short story about pilot Halley.

This was not a politically divisive issue at the time.", "2.

The money goes directly to those workers, in hopes that the business will succeed and money will Trickle Up to the investors.  FDR coined the phrase \"trickle-down\" as an epithet for his opponents.", "3. The tax debate eventually became a political issue, with Democrats (but not JFK) advocating higher tax rates and Republicans advocating lower tax rates.

This was the missing link for me because Kriya Yoga will open up a mental highway through the universe. I was 21 and depressed when I started inquiring into my existence. Frequently I visited bookstores searching for the answers to life. Then one day in 1974 I walked into a bookstore in Long Beach California on Long beach blvd down town next to the old post office. The owner of the store said young man I've been watching you for several months you're searching for God right, I said right. She said I've been saving five note books for you look at them if they appeal to you give me ten dollars and they're yours. I was raised Baptist and had never heard of Paramahansa Yogananda or SRF but I understood instantly what was contained in those note books - The books were very old SRF lessons that are made available only for their students, I was lucky to get them. After careful review I quickly gave the lady ten dollars and have been blessed everyday of my life the only thing missing was Kriya Yoga Instructions.  I am now 62  Amazon, I am forever grateful to you for making them available for $0.99 may the creator of the universe forever bless you! I never became a member of SRF because I felt, and knew, the Great Masters were with me because they put this great knowledge in my hands. If my house was to catch fire today the first thing I would grab would be my SRF lessons! The Lady that gave them to me was an angel, I received my salvation for $10.99...\n"], ["\n  I was initiated into this practice by Yogananda's immediate disciples in 1958. I was a sophomore at Occidental College, a half-hour's walk from Yogananda's monastic center overlooking Los Angeles. My name tells it all: Thomas, a devout doubter. The SRF ceremony, the oath they made me sign, the churchianity into which they had wrapped up this simple, easy, natural, and very potent practice \u2014 all this left me doubting. But I kept at it, and God led me to a Catholic hermitage in Big Sur, where the good Camaldolese let me continue to be a yogi and a Thomas. Here at last, in this booklet from Yogananda's own hand, is the real heart of Kriya, which with this 99-cent Kindle book is now completely open sourced. This is what Lahiri Mahasaya really wanted!\n"], ["\n  This is an excellent little booklet which was originally given to Yogananda's initiates after initiation. It is of great value to those researching the legacy of Swami Yogananda.If you've ever wondered whether the techniques currently taught by SRF are the same as the techniques taught by Yogananda to his early disciples, then this booklet is for you. The major differences between the kriya yoga of this booklet and that of the current SRF initiation is as follows: 1) Mantra is \"sung\" in each chakra 2) Khechari (not by name) is discussed. 3) The path of the breath (\"life force\") is elliptical as it is explained in Autobiography of a Yogi. It always seemed strange to me that Yogananda in his autobiography explained that kriya yoga involved an elliptical path of the Prana around the spine, but the lessons of his organisation had the Prana going up and down the same path. The techniques of this little booklet brought many of Yogananda's early disciples to Samadhi and beyond.

Reisman is an Austrian School economist and student of Ludwig von Mises, but he is exceptional in this way --- his writing is as clear as a bell. High School students can easily understand even his most academic work. Here, Reisman makes just two points: That Nazi Germany was a socialist state, not a capitalist one, and that every kind of socialism must, because of its nature, lead to totalitarian rule. Reisman begins by pointing out the obvious; \"Nazi\" is an abbreviation for the word \"Nationalsozialistische,\" which in English means \"national socialism.\" It is interesting that thousands of academics over the last 75 years have been successful in overlooking this fact as they made the case that Germany under Hitler was a capitalist state.', u'The orientation of Reisman\\'s work here is economic. The word \"fascism\" is not found and the word \"Hitler\" is used only once. This is an example of the accuracy of Reisman\\'s understanding of history. Hitler, we have discovered since his time, was not a fascist. The ideology he espoused was \"Hitlerism.\" Not knowing the difference has flummoxed the brains of almost everybody writing on the subject.', u'Reisman explains that every kind of socialism is marked by government ownership of the means of production, but with Nazism, that ownership is not direct ownership. It is a tacit ownership. Property is not actually appropriated by the government nor managed by government agents. Property, that is, the land, buildings, equipment, and such, remains in private hands while every other characteristic of ownership, planning and decision-making, for instance, accedes to the appropriate government agency.'][u' While individuals, partnerships, companies, and corporations own the property, all the functional and practical powers of ownership transfer to the state.', u\"Doesn't that sound a little familiar? It should, because it describes the economic system of the United States of America. That system is not Nazism and it isn't capitalism, it's fascism pure and simple. Every modern economic system is basic fascism trending, some more than others, toward totalitarianism. Think not? Jump to the paragraph above and read that description again. Of course there are degrees of differences such as between the U.S. and Sweden. If we are free to start businesses it is because we are allowed, not because the marketplace is free and open as the concept of liberty would imply.\", u'Reisman would not agree with this assessment. He defines our economy as \"hampered.\" This to me is rather awkward. I\\'m saying exactly what he says, but I prefer to call it \"basic fascism trending toward totalitarianism.\" I think he would come to agree with me if we ever meet. And by totalitarian, I mean this\\u2014a state of consensus. A consensus regarding what? And that\\'s just it. Consensus in all things. The central character of totalitarianism is that questions regarding the common good of society are to be settled by the appropriate panel of experts\\u2014from the legally acceptable light bulb, to the suitable sources of energy, to every aspect of healthcare and proper diet, to how you are to raise your children, and on and on and on into every area of human activity down to the most trivial. (Toilet paper comes to mind.)', u'So, totalitarianism is \"politics by consensus.\" Totalitarianism is the use of political power and the resources of the state to shape the behavior of citizens. It is a system where individuals must unavoidably recognize a unanimity of consent from which follows an attitude of \"political correctness\" that, in turn, governs every area of human activity.']", ["\n  One of the great myths propagated in the 20th Century was Nazism is a Right-Wing Ideology. This is a total canard put forth by Joseph Stalin and others in Communist leadership. George Reisman, one of the truly great AND UNSUNG economists of our time, puts this Left-Wing myth to bed once and for all. He does it with incisive argument and lively writing. Bottom Line: The LEFT is about augmenting State power and the RIGHT is about the diminution of State power. Reisman both understands this and conveys it beautifully to the reader. This is a MUST READ publication for anyone interested in truth and understanding the perfidy of the Left!\n"], ["\n  George Reisman is a good teacher, he clearly understands his topic, and has the added gift of being a good writer.

Unlike some of the people who didn't care for the book - I never read the New Yorker article.  It may be that the book doesn't add enough new info to  excite folks who have read that article.  But to me the book threw out a  good number of new ideas and concepts very quickly and very clearly.  I  found his ability to draw a nexus between things that, on the surface seem  very divergent, was very interesting, and he did it smoothly, without  jumping around a lot.\", u\"The thrust of the book is that there are three  things that can converge to bring about dramatic and perhaps unexpectedly  fast changes in our society.  These are the context (the situational  environment - especially when it's near the balance or 'tipping point'),  the idea, and the people involved.  His point is that very small changes in  any or several of the context, the quality of the idea (which he calls  'stickiness', ie how well the idea sticks), or whether the idea reaches a  very small group of key people can trigger a dramatic epidemic of change in  society.\", u'\"In a given process or system some people matter more  than others.\" (p.19).  \"The success of any kind of social  epidemic is heavily dependent on the involvement of people with a  particular and rare set of social gifts.\" (p.33).', u'He divides these  gifted people into three categories: Connectors, Mavens and Salespeople.  \"Sprinkled among every walk of life ... are a handful of people with a  truly extraordinary knack of making friends and acquaintances.  They are  Connectors.\"  (p. 41).  \"I always keep up with people.\" (p.  44 quoting a \"Connector\").'][u'  \"in the case of Connectors,  their ability to span many different worlds is a function of something  intrinsic to their personality, some combination of curiosity,  self-confidence, sociability, and energy.\" (p.49).  \"The point  about Connectors is that by having a foot in so many different worlds they  have the effect of bringing them all together.\"  (p.51).', u'\"The  word Maven comes from the Yiddish, and it means one who accumulates  knowledge.\" (p. 60).  \"The fact that Mavens want to help, for no  other reason than because they like to help, turns out to be an awfully  effective way of getting someone\\'s attention.\"  (p.67).  \"The  one thing that a Maven is not is a persuader.  To be a Maven is to be a  teacher.  But it is also, even more emphatically to be a student.\"  (p.69).', u'\"There is also a select group of people -- Salesmen -- with  the skills to persuade us when we are unconvinced of what we are  hearing.\" (p. 70).  He goes on to describe an individual named Tom Gau  who is a Salesman.  \"He seems to have some indefinable trait,  something powerful and contagious and irresistible that goes beyond what  comes out of his mouth, that makes people who meet him want to agree with  him.  It\\'s energy.  It\\'s enthusiasm.  It\\'s charm.  It\\'s likability.  It\\'s  all those things and yet something more.\"  (p. 73).', u'He then goes  into the importance of actually gathering empirical data about ideas, and  not just relying on theory or assumption to determine quality, or as he  calls it, \\'stickiness.\\'  He gives examples of where assumptions have been  debunked with data.  \"Kids don\\'t watch when they are stimulated and  look away when they are bored.  They watch when they understand and look  away when they are confused.\" (p.102).  \"Children actually don\\'t  like commercials as much as we thought they did.\" (p. 118)  \"The  driving force for a preschooler is not a search for novelty, like it is  with older kids, it\\'s a search for understanding and predictability.\"  (p. 126)  Hence why your three year old can watch those Barney videos over  and over until the tape breaks - it becomes predictable after the third or  fourth viewing.  This is probably also why Barney suddenly falls out of  favor when predictability is less important than novelty.', u\"Finally,  there's a point he makes he calls the rule of 150.  He starts with some  British anthropologists idea that brain size, neocortex size actually, is  related to the ability to handle the complexities of social groups.  The  larger the neocortex, the larger the social group that can be managed.  She  then charts primate neocortex size against known average social group sizes  for various primates, other than humans.  Then she plugs human neocortex  size into the equation, and out pops 147.8, or about 150.  Now that would  be not so interesting, except that he goes on to talk about this religious  group, the Hutterites.  They are clannish like the Amish or Mennonites, and  they have a rule that when a colony approaches 150, they split into two and  start a new one.  He follows that by noting that Military organizations  generally split companies at 150-200.  And then he talks about Gore - the  company that makes Goretex, among other things.  They have a ~150 employee  per plant rule.\", u'\"At a bigger size you have to impose complicated  hierarchies and rules and regulations and formal measures to try to command  loyalty and cohesion.  But below 150...it is possible to achieve the same  goals infomally.\" (p.180)', u'\"When things get larger than that,  people become strangers to one another.\" (p.181)', u'\"Crossing the  150 line is a small change that can make a big difference.\" (p.  183)', u\"On the whole, I thought the book sparked thought and converstaion,  and will make me look at life and business a little differently.  To me  that's a good book.\"]", ["\n  Malcolm Gladwell, a staff writer for New Yorker Magazine, in The Tipping Point, writes a fascinating study of human behavior patterns, and shows us where the smallest things can trigger an epidemic of change.  Though loaded  with statistics, the numbers are presented in a way that makes the book  read like an exciting novel.  Gladwell also gives several examples in  history, where one small change in behavior created a bigger change on a  national level.  He also studies the type of person or group that it takes  to make that change.", "Gladwell's first example is the resurgence of the  popularity of Hush Puppies, which had long been out of fashion, and were  only sold in small shoe stores.  Suddenly, a group of teenage boys in East  Village, New York, found the cool to wear.  Word-of-mouth advertising that  these trend-setters were wearing the once-popular suede shoes set off an  epidemic of fashion change, and boys all over America had to have the  \"cool\" shoes.", "Galdwell also examines the difference in  personality it takes to trigger the change.  For example, we all know of  Paul Revere's famous ride, but how many of us know that William Dawes made  a similar ride?  The difference was that people listened to Revere and not  to Dawes.  Why?  Revere knew so many different people.  He knew who led  which village, knew which doors to knock on to rouse the colonists.  Dawes  didn't know that many people and therefore could only guess which people to  give his message.", "There are several other phenomena that Gladwell  examines, showing the small things that spark a change, from the dip in the  New York City crime rate to the correlation between depression, smoking and  teen suicide.  If you want to change the world for the better, this book  will give you an insight into the methods that work, and those that will  backfire.  It's all in knowing where to find The Tipping Point.", "Jo @  MyShelf.Com\n"]], "rating_change": "", "video": "", "current_price": "", "count_customer_reviews": "", "previous_price": "", "image": ["http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517phG9GL8L._SS30_.jpg"], "category_path": "Kindle Store / Kindle Short Reads / 30 minutes (12-21 pages) / Business & Money"}

One thing I remember from Dogs Best Friend training was a trainer whom had a family pet as a child who only responded to \"sit, sit, sit, sit.\"  It would not answer to just the command \"sit.\" Patricia teaches us the value of the 1-word command, and the usage of positive, rewards-based training.  This book is more than just a training book it provides valuable insight into the way dogs think.  You will be amazed at how much your pet can learn when you start speaking their language! This book teaches us to think about how we are behaving in front of our dogs, and how important it is to \"Be the leader of the pack, A benevolent leader,\" as she would say.', u'Any dog lover is at a loss without this book.'][u'  For more on Trisha, those of you whom can tune in to Wisconsin Public Radio, Saturdays Trisha hosts a program called \"Calling all Pets\" which answers pet related problems.  I do believe you can view past shows on WPR\\'s website.', u'Best of luck in the care of your dog, and remember--your behavior can mean the difference between having a good pet and having a great pet!']", ["\n  This pamphlet is a wonderful introduction into developing a the leader relationship with your family's canine companion.  It introduces the concept of NILIF \"Nothing In Life is Free\", a positive training method used to place humans in the alpha role of the pack.  It is also often used on proven aggressive dogs, but is better to do it right from the start.  I would not recommend using the pamphlet as the sole source for training the family dog, but it's an excellent start.  A very fast read with easy, understandable language.  Highly recommended.  Excellent gift for every new dog owning family.\n"]], "rating_change": "", "video": "", "current_price": "", "count_customer_reviews": "", "previous_price": "", "image": ["http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512CB55yxnL._SS30_.jpg"], "category_path": "Kindle Store / Kindle Short Reads / 30 minutes (12-21 pages) / Crafts, Hobbies & Home"}

Together and individually, the two authors have written some of the most suspenseful stories of the past two decades. In the short story \"Extraction,\" they turned back the clock to an earlier time when Aloysius and his younger brother Diogenes were kids growing up in New Orleans (the story takes place before the traumatic event that resulted in Diogenes' brain damage).", "The story begins in modern times, where Aloysius, his ward Constance, and Monsieur Bertin, one of Aloysius's childhood tutors, are having dinner in Pendergast's Riverside Drive mansion. A disagreement over the proper way to cook pasta led to a flashback story that took place in New Orleans when Aloysius was nine years old, and his brother Diogenes was six. With their mother in the hospital and their father away on business, their Uncle Everett was staying with them. Diogenes has just lost a baby tooth. Most kids did the tooth-under-the-pillow thing and hoped the Tooth Fairy would be generous, but in the French Quarter of New Orleans, an old tradition overrode the Tooth Fairy. Legend said that if you didn't bring your tooth to a mysterious old recluse named Maurus Dufour on the next full moon, he would come and get you.", "When Diogenes seemed determined to bundle his tooth off to Dufour, Aloysius attempted to intervene to disprove the legend. And that's where things began to go awry. As with most Pendergast stories, creepiness and mayhem ensued, and you just knew that the story wasn't going to have a happy ending for all.", "\"Extraction\" was an engaging, suspenseful short story (about 300 Kindle locations). I think Preston and Child fans will enjoy the story, which serves to fill in another gap about Aloysius's and Diogenes' early relationship.\n"], ["\n  Anyone who has read Preston & Child's \"Pendergast\" series knows two things.  1) Aloysius' brother Diogenes was a piece of work and not in a good way and 2) Diogenes has his own 3-book arc within the Pendergast series.  Whomever has yet the read the series (refer to the back of the single for information about where to start each series), this book lite will go a long way to explaining some of the relationship \"issues\" between Aloysius and Diogenes.", "Pendergast and his ward, Constance are entertaining an old friend of Pendergast's from New Orleans.  On the menu is a pasta dish which is initially ruined because the pasta was boiled too soft - not \"al dente\" - literally meaning \"to the tooth\" in Italian.  Well, the discussion of the best way to eat pasta segues into the telling of an incident between Aloysius and Diogenes regarding their beliefs in the Tooth Fairy.", "$.99 might seem steep for such a short tale, but it is another piece to the puzzle whether or not you have read the other books.\n"], ["\n  I'm not going to say too much of substance in this review because, yes, the story is short, but it was absolutely worth the $1.00 I paid.  I think that was the whole point of releasing this - to get you ready for the novel coming in December.  Special Agent A.X.L.

And sadly, I think most readers agreed in that case that the short story was far better than the novel that followed it.', u'WILDERNESS is different - it actually gives valuable backstory to INNOCENCE, drops some not-so-subtle clues as to the life our protagonist is going to lead in the future, and packs a scary brush-with-death chase scene into a few short pages that you can read under fifteen minutes.', u'Not going to write any spoilers - but WILDERNESS quickly covers Addison\\'s life from birth until a defining moment when he is eight-years-old.

But after reading this wonderful little book it challenged me to learn all that I could about the strange world of quantum physics.  I learned about the weird actions of the electron.  How the electron that orbits the nucleus is not always in particle form.  But at times exists in an invisible wave like state (like a cloud,everywhere at once) until the very act of observation causes this invisible matter to blink into existence in a particle form. Some of the question that Annette brought out were the same questions that I had.  How does the electron know that some one is looking at it, and why does it react somewhat differently for each observer?  Was it responding according to what the scientist believes?  This really shook me to my core, and a verse in Hebrews chapter 11 verse 1 was brought to my mind. Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.  Verse 3 also says that through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.  Could we perhaps be talking about a very part of the spiritual realm?  Perhaps the very act of speaking and declaring the Word of God bring into manifestation the signs and miracles that we so desperately need in this day and time.  The more I studied this invisible world of quantum physics I found no roadblocks to hinder my faith but only more reasons to believe in the existence of an almighty God more magnificent and wonderful then I had henceforth dared to believe.  A word of caution however.  Our enemy (Satan) is still using the same tactics that he used on Eve in the Garden of Eden.'][u'  In Genesis chapter 3 verse 5 while trying to get her to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he told Eve  For God does know that in the day  ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened,and ye shall be as gods,knowing good and evil.  there are some individuals who take a portion of the truth found in quantum physics and run with it in all kinds of different directions, with some even claiming that we can become our own gods.  In fact this is the only issue that I have with Annette book is the 2 books that she recommends for more study. I feel a better choice would be titles by John Polkinghorne, Bernard Haisch, Henry F Schaefer, Gerald L Schroeder, or a book soon to be published called Elsewhen by David Van Koevering.

I don't know about you, but I want a victorious life and one that is a testimony to Jesus.The knowledge in this book will help bring us there. Anette clearly explains how our Lord walked in these principals and how He has given them to us, if we will only take the time to understand them.

I have gained houses, cars, boats, businesses, friends, a family, and numerous creative and prospering ideas using the principles set forth in this book.', u\"In the last 25 years I have spent thousands of hours teaching these ideas to other people. I've seen many people use the ideas in this book to create something new in their life, and I have seen others who are not so successful with it. I want you to be one of the successful ones.\", u'How to Succeed with your List', u\"First, let's take a little test. Take a sheet of paper (or your word processor) and without looking at the book write down the 'Three Positive Rules of Accomplishment' that are the key to this technique.\", u'Then go back and compare them to the text. How did you do?', u'Did you miss a few? I did when I first tried this test myself.', u'If you read this book and it never goes farther than words and ideas in your mind, then you have lost the advantage of it.', u'The key to success with this method it to DO IT, not just think about it. Don??t think that by reading it, even many times, that you will know it.'][u' That would be like thinking that you know how to ride a bicycle just by reading about it. In order to master the bicycle, you have to get on it and ride, learning to keep your balance as you move forward. That is exactly the way you learn the principles of conscious creation taught by ??It Works??.', u\"When I first started using the technique in this book, I wrote my first list, and started getting great results. Then after a month or so, I stopped writing and reviewing the list, and tried to 'do it in my head'. I didn't get the same results.\", u'I went back to using the list, and the great results started happening again. Then I got what I wanted and let things slide, and the cycle repeated.', u'Meanwhile I started studying the ideas and teaching them to others. In the process I learned some interesting things I am sharing with you.', u'What I learned is that each of us has a spark from the Creator which is our own personal creator, like a genie from a magic lamp. The problem with this genie is that he responds to every thought in my mind as if it were a command. If I think of something with desire, he starts creating that for me. If I start to worry or fear, he starts to erase that creation.', u'Wherever I put my attention, the genie starts multiplying that attention into a real experience in my life. All of this creation takes place in a part of my mind called the subconscious mind.  The subconscious mind is the part of my mind that holds the tremendous creative power that I can learn to tap into and use.  However, it has a special way of working that I must understand if I want to use my subconscious mind power effectively.', u'If my attention wanders all over the place, my subconscious becomes full of half-created thought-forms and my life is chaotic or boring. That??s because the genie is busy trying to do a million different things at once, many of which contradict each other. His efforts always follow in the track of my attention, and until I get my attention going in a constant direction, I don??t get the results I would like.', u\"The plan given in 'It Works' helps me to control my attention, and put that genie to work with enough time and focus to produce real and complete results. It will work the same way for you.\", u'My conscious mind sets the agenda, but I often get distracted by the half-formed and malformed effects of previous wishes and desires. Many of those desires are unconscious, created with incomplete understanding or fear or worry.  The genie does what I tell him, but he listens to my daydreams and worries and treats them as commands.', u\"This creative power responds to what I believe. I have come to realize that what I believe is not necessarily the same as what I think. It's easy to know what I believe - it is what I act on. It is what I do. Even while I am unable to admit to myself what I really believe, my subconscious mind is working to make circumstances, opportunities, and events in my life to experience those beliefs.\", u'How do I change what I believe, so that I can get what I want? There is a simple way to do this. It has been discovered and rediscovered by teachers and writers throughout the ages.', u'Here it is:', u'I can imagine what I want, I can pretend that it is so, and I can repeat this over and over.', u\"The creative genie of my subconscious mind responds to imagination, focused attention, and repetition. That's what the book 'It Works' is all about.\", u'How to Get Faster and Better Results', u\"Here are things that will help you create more successfully when you use the technique presented in ??It Works??. These are things that I have discovered in the last 25 years of using 'It Works.' Each of these is a suggestion based on actual experiences with using the list. Use the ideas that sound good to you.\", u\"The most important thing is to do exactly what it says. Follow the plan exactly: Create a list, include what you really desire in order of its importance to you, read the list three times a day, think of the items on the list as often as you can, and don't tell anyone what you are doing.\", u\"For faster demonstration of results, you can rewrite the list each day, even if it hasn't changed. Reorder the items on the list according to their importance to you. Doing this makes the ideas new again, and will lead to more rapid success. It??s also important to do something physical with your ideas, as soon as possible. Writing them out is a way to give them entry into the outer world of manifestation. It creates a toehold for their growth into physical reality.\", u\"If you have a tape recorder, you can read the list out loud in a firm voice and tape it. Then play the tape over and over again (perhaps in your car as you commute to and from work). This needs to be done and played in private. That's easy nowadays since you can get an inexpensive tape player with headphones.\", u\"I found a little digital recorder that records into it's own computer memory, and then plays it back over and over again through headphones. You can also do this with the 'Sound Recorder' program that is built into most personal computers.\", u\"Put real amounts, specific items, and specific dates in your list. Some people worry that this is 'outlining' and delays manifestation. But what good is it to get Coke when you want Pepsi, or Pepsi when you want Coke? You don??t plant strawberries and expect to harvest watermelons. The most important thing is not a particular item on your list, but developing your power of conscious creation.\", u'Do you have trouble remembering the items on your list? If so, it may be that they are not really that important to you. Try memorizing the items on your list.', u'Are you having trouble finding ten things to put on your list? Are you unsure which things should really be on the list? Here??s an easy way to build your list: ask yourself- ??What do I think about all day??? That is what should be on your list. You may have to start by listing your worries, and then turn each of them into a positive desire. For example, what do I worry about? What would need to happen for me to not worry about this any more?', u'If you have trouble finding things that you want, try thinking of it in another way. What would you like to see happen?', u'How will you know it is working?', u'When you receive an idea about something that is on your list, act on it in a positive way. Sometimes the thing you want requires a few intermediate steps. Be ready to go through several doorways as they open before you, to reach your goal. If you want a car, perhaps you will find yourself creating a new set of tires first, or a garage to keep the car in.', u\"Realize that many of the things you want will find you. You will be tempted to say, 'but I didn't do anything, it just happened.'  Your inner mind genie will use the simplest and most efficient way to create the results you imagine. It doesn't care who gets the credit. After a while you won't either!\", u'Remember that your genie is working nonstop, according to the program that you set for him. If you say, ??this can??t be working??, he will do his best to make that seem true ?V even while he continues his nonstop creation of the other things you ask for.', u'How will you know it is working? For most people it is not one thing, or two things, but the fact that one thing after another manifests in their lives. The first thing you get from your list seems to be a coincidence, the second is luck, the third is serendipity, and the forth is a miracle. Finally after many creations, when your friends start wondering what the heck is going on, you will realize that there is a simple and rational law in operation, and that you know how to use it.', u\"Get excited and enthusiastic about the good things coming into your life. If this doesn't seem natural to you, go ahead and use your 'power of pretend' to fake it until you make it. Appreciation is the oil of the engine of creation. Enthusiasm and excitement are manifestations of your appreciation, and confirmation of your positive expectation.\", u'The attitudes that will delay your success or confuse your creation are jealousy, envy, resentment, reservations, uncertainty, and indecisiveness.  Put all of those to the side. The more you recognize your own creative ability, the less you will care about those things that these attitudes have been attached to. You just won??t have time for those ways of thinking any more.', u\"There is no such thing as a negative thought - every thought has a positive result in reproducing itself. Every thing you think about grows in your mind and becomes part of your physical life. That??s why it is so important to control what you are thinking. The key to controlling your mind is replacing the thoughts that create what you don't want, with the thoughts that create what you do want. You do not resist the old thoughts, you replace them by putting your attention somewhere else. Using your list is your key to accomplishing this. Use this physical tool to reinforce the thoughts that you want.\", u'Think of your subconscious mind as being like a sailboat in the middle of the ocean. The sailboat is blown everywhere, back and forth, by the wind, which is the power of thought. It needs a keel and a rudder to be able to set a course and make way to a certain destination. Your list is the keel and the rudder of your subconscious sailboat.', u'Thought follows a certain structure in your mind. The idea comes first, then the belief, then the attitude, and then the behavior. Your strongest foundation, the anchor of your thinking, begins with your behavior. Change your behavior, then change the attitude that changing the behavior reveals, then change the belief that inspires the attitude. Grab hold of an idea that is bigger and more inclusive than the small ideas that have kept you poor and unhappy.', u'When you are tempted to tell everyone what you are doing to make the changes in your life, send them a copy of this book instead.  After you have received 40 things you have asked for, you can start talking about the process you are using. Keep a list of everything you get until you receive 40 things you have asked for.', u'Many people find this book, and use it to get one important thing, and then abandon this method. How did this book come into your life? Your genie brought it to you, or brought you to it, in response to your conscious or unconscious desire to create a specific experience, or to understand creation itself. Take advantage of this experience, and make this intelligent, conscious creation a way of life, not a one-time experience.', u'??Hey Peter, get back in the boat!?? - the other 11 apostles', u'Trying to control other people and make decisions for them is a misuse of them, and of your own creative power. The most important thing you can make is a decision. Trying to take that opportunity for creation away from others is based on fear, not love. Fear in your mind will generally create things you do not want. Lewt people learn their lessons. God loves them, too.', u'I learned something wonderful long ago, that will give you freedom. I can??t prove anything to you about anything important or meaningful. However, I can tell you how you can experiment and prove these things to yourself. If I walked on water, you would be looking for the rocks. If you walk on water, you will know that there are no rocks. Using this list will show you how to walk on the water of your life. You will have to learn to politely ignore your friends as they yell: ??Hey Peter, get back in the boat!??', u'The Toyota Principle', u\"The subconscious mind creation process goes on all the time. You don't have to be good to make it work. You don't have to chant, exercise, or repeat magic words. You are rich now with the results of what you have been thinking about. Your life is always full of something. If you want to be rich with something else, change what you are thinking about.\", u\"As you develop your ability to consciously direct your creation process, as you build your confidence and increase your will power, your results will come more quickly and be more satisfying. Don't delay this process by calling the results coincidence. Wait until you have received at least 40 items on your list (by receiving something and replacing the list item with a new item) before you judge the results as coincidence or creation.\", u\"You are already a success at creating what you are thinking about - everyone is. The biggest enemy of conscious control is self-importance - which may manifest in disguise as self-deprecation, worry about what others think of you, or the desire to have others approve of you. Don't let your ego distract your from taking control of your mind and your life.\", u'Everything in your life is there because you have asked for it through either desire or fear. Nothing comes to you by itself. I call this the \"Toyota Principle\" because there used to be a commercial advertisement on television for a certain car company with the catchphrase \"You asked for it - you got it - Toyota!\\' When you have used your list for a while, you will begin to see this is true, and then vast realms of possibility will open in your life.', u\"It's a friendly universe.\", u\"If you are of a certain religious orientation, you might be concerned about this creative process and think it is a possible affront to God. I don't think it is. Think of the New Testament phrase, ??Pray without ceasing.?? I have decided that this is a description of what we all do all the time. We pray nonstop without knowing it. Practice of the method of conscious creation will show you what prayer is, how it works, and that it is always functioning. I am firmly convinced that learning how my mind works, and how to use it more effectively to help myself and others, is what God wants me to do. How about you?\", u\"You don't have to believe in God to use the list. However, don't be surprised if using the list shows you that there is order and structure to the universe, including your mind as a part of that universe. Your world is a lot closer to you and more responsive to you, than you may have considered it to be. It's a friendly universe.\", u'Be careful about including other people on your list. If you want joy and happiness with Jane or Bill, is the joy and happiness more important, or the relationship with Jane or Bill? Maybe the best way to be happy with Jane is let her go find Bill, and let Suzy come find you. As long as you are focused on what someone can give to you, you aren??t yet completely experiencing love.', u'It may be tempting to think your success is dependent on the channel it happens to come through - your job, your family, a particular relationship or thing you possess. Time and experience will show you that this is not so. In the meantime, place your sense of appreciation and thankfulness on the Creator within you, who has made you in his image as a creator. When the river of your life changes its channel, you had better be ready to go with the flow.', u'How fast will it work? Faster than you will expect.  I put the number one item on my list last week and it manifested in two days ?V and I thought it would be six months or maybe never. Fortunately, while writing and then rereading that list item, I suspended my disbelief. Even before your pen finishes the sentence, the act of creation has begun. Of course there is no magic in the pen or paper ?V the magic is in making the decision a physical thing instead of just a mental idea. No matter how long you use this method, there will be times when you are just utterly amazed at what ??happens?? to you. (It isn??t happening, you are creating it.) How fast can it happen? Don??t blink twice ?V you??ll miss it.', u'Everything you think will try to prove itself ?V including your skepticism. If you are afraid of what others will think of you, or of what you will think of yourself, then you may be fooling yourself while thinking you are being completely rational. The world is plastic to the molding power of your thoughts ?V even while you think this is untrue, or don??t have a thought about it at all. Everything lives and moves and has its being in a sea of self-modifying thought. You can prove this to yourself, and put it to effective use, with the simple experiment of work with the list for a few weeks or months.', u\"It doesn't take much time or effort. You have nothing to lose. No one will even know you are doing it. They will just think that you have suddenly become incredibly lucky, intelligent, charming, and good looking. It helps to smile a lot.\", u'Creating complete mind pictures is very helpful. That is another book in itself.  Feeling joy and enthusiasm about your mental creation is very helpful. It will start to happen naturally as you use this process over and over, because ?{', u'It Works!.']", ["\n  This tiny book describes one of the shortest ways to manifest your fondest dreams. Write it down - don't talk about it - and give thanks. It's simple but effective. I like that I can carry the book with me everywhere. It convinced me that if you know what you want and write a short list, you set something (Divine perhaps) in motion that will answer your requests. I think it's amazing that in 1926 the author outlined a premise about a great magnetic power in the universe that's just now being discussed scientifically in books like \"The Field\". That to me is proof of its timeless message. After this book, some other good followup books are \"Write It Down Make It Happen\" and \"I'm Rich Beyond My Wildest Dreams.\"\n"]], "rating_change": "", "video": "", "current_price": "", "count_customer_reviews": "", "previous_price": "", "image": ["http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sdC-c1S9L._SS30_.jpg"], "category_path": "Kindle Store / Kindle Short Reads / 45 minutes (22-32 pages) / Religion & Spirituality"}

I have read his Pursuit of Man & Pursuit of God; both were enlightening materials. Keys To The Deeper Life, however, is the sounding of the voice of a prophet. It is indeed an apocalypse of spiritual truths. A.W Tozer looked deeply into the problem facing the church and delivered an oratory on the root-cause. He exposed many blemishes the Church institution of the day would rather not discuss. This book is reminiscent of the Lord\\'s \"Sermon on the Mount\" - in tone, very direct; and in purpose, transparently corrective. A.W Tozer challenged the action and motivation of evangelicals. In every paragraph, A.W Tozer served a bi-nutritional diet of flame and water. With his characteristic earnestness he exposed the hypocrisy of contemporary Christianity with an unspoken plea for reform, yet understanding that \"reform\" is not a natural tendency of established religion, he showed the futility of going about Church as it then (and currently) exists.', u'If the book reads like the Bible, it is because the writer was merely expressing the spirit of the bible writers in a modern tongue.

It is required reading for one of her high school classes.  Reading the book, I was pleasantly surprised when I saw numerous references to Michael Roger's ground-breaking 1976 story on Lacks in Rolling Stone magazine.  I've enjoyed Roger's writing and insight for many years. He is one of those writers who always seem to be ahead of the curve and in the case of genetic engineering he was light years ahead. One of my favorite Roger's novels is \"Forbidden Sequence\".  It was published in 1988 and it's a thriller plotted around the science and ethics of genetic engineering. Good luck finding it, copies are hard to find.  So, to refresh my memory I downloaded a Kindle version of Roger's original Rolling Stone article from Amazon.  No surprise, the writing was fresh and vivid, and in many ways the comprehensive article was a better read than Skloot's book. Roger's added an updated commentary, which is also a great read.  Highly recommended!\n"], ["\n  This article is well written and very informative on a little known subject matter and a great lady named Henrietta Lacks.

Rogers tells in the beginning that he was something of a nerd and wrote strange stories, submitted them to magazines and piled up the rejection slips, but finally received notification that \"Rolling Stone\" was buying one of his stories.  The magazine later figured out that Rogers was knowledgable about science.  Science was his main interest and also the future.  His article on Henrietta Lacks was written in the 1970s.', u'Rebecca Skloot\\'s book \"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\" set a fire under this story, but Rogers\\' article being reviewed here gives the basic information about who Henrietta Lacks was and why she is important.  Before it became the story of Henrietta Lacks, her privacy was guarded and she was called Helen Lane, abbreviated to the HeLa story.  Genetic engineering was just coming into its own, and the HeLa story became very important in the science world mid-twentieth century.', u\"Henrietta Lacks was a black woman from Virginia who had apparently worked in the fields and married her first cousin, David Lacks.  They eventually had a family and moved to what is now the Dundalk area of Baltimore so that David could work at Bethlehem Steel at Sparrow's Point.

Henrietta had her last baby and after that she noticed a lump on her belly and thought it was another pregnancy, but doctors at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore diagnosed cervical cancer, but it was unlike any they had ever seen.  It was the most fast-growing cervical cancer they had ever encountered.  Unknown to Henrietta, and without her permission, cancer cells from the cervix and non-cancerous cells were collected.\"][u'  This was done before, but the difference was that these cells from Henrietta could be kept alive and grown, and this had never been seen before. ( The cells, now called the \"Hela immortal cell line\" over time since 1951 when Henrietta died, have allowed scientists to grow 20 tons of her cells for biomedical research. ) They were used in the development of the polio vaccine.  It is an amazing story and a little frightening since these cells can contaminate others in the lab and they are very virulent cancer cells.', u\"Michael Rogers was extremely curious and interested in finding out the real identity of Helen Lane.  Things in the science world were more strict in the 50s and 60s as far as keeping names and information confidential. The cells were originally cultured by Dr. George Gey who was, by the time of Rogers' research, deceased.  No one wanted to reveal the real name, not even the widow of Dr. Gey.  As it turned out, the name slipped out one day and the name of Helen Lane was not needed anymore.\", u'This is a fascinating story about a woman who lived to be only 31 years old, and whose husband never remarried, but underwent blood tests along with his and Henrietta\\'s children by John Hopkins.  The family never quite understood why and didn\\'t understand the entire \"cell\" case and had eventually, so many years after their wife and mother\\'s death, forgotten about the HeLa cells and had never understood the complexity of it.', u\"Through Michael Rogers' writing as well as Rebecca Skloot's, the world learned about Henrietta Lacks.  Her cells are still alive and being used around the world in scientific research, so in that respect, this woman who was born in 1920 still lives on in her immortal cells.\", u'An excellent article which I highly recommend.']"], "rating_change": "", "video": "", "current_price": "", "count_customer_reviews": "", "previous_price": "", "image": ["http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41mgJvIsBxL._SS30_.jpg"], "category_path": "Kindle Store / Kindle Short Reads / 45 minutes (22-32 pages) / Science & Math"}

The author has included full color photos of finished journal pages and a section on \"Art Prompts\" to inspire you.  She gives suggestions such as \"Doodle a \"list\" of things that you love or describes you; a camera, curls for curly hair..\".  There are also links to bonus material found outside of the book.

Eye contacting really plays a vital role in everyone\u2019s life. I remembered when I got admission in University and there were many young female Professors during the first semester. I really became nervous and confused while having conversation with them. I felt very bad as I did not have that much courage to make eye contact during question/answers and it took me a lot time to adjust in university especially because of having no confidence for making eye contact. This book has highlighted an important aspect of gaining real life confidence. I was inspired by the chapter about \u201cTips and Tricks of powerful eye contacting\u201d. Writer has experienced and done a lot of research in noting gestures while eye contacting and have concluded with the best summary and guide in the form of this wonderful book. I recommend this book to our young generations particularly the students of universities who have just started studying for higher education and are facing a lot of low morale/self esteem issues. Thanks to Author for the fabulous and splendid work and message conveyed through this phenomenal guide.\n"], ["\n  This book, while being a really thorough book on how and why we should improve out eye contact abilities, is also people magnet. The title really stands out! When I was reading it on the subway and being aware of my own eye contact, people would see what's on my kindle and make eye contact with me. I'd look back at them and make a little connection. Robert Moore also validates the eye gazing I've always enjoyed doing with myself in the mirror. Those experiences have helped me know and trust myself more. Somehow these ideas sounded so weird to talk to people about before, but now that he expressed this ancient knowledge in simple, practical terms that apply to modern life I feel a huge shift in acceptance of who I am and what I am here to share with the world. The simple yet profound insights about the power of eye contact has transformed the way I relate to everyone I meet, as long as I remember to look them in the eyes.\n"], ["\n  Even though this book seems to talk about how to communicate a girl, I found that this book can be used for anyone for things other than \"seducing a girl\". Knowing how to communicate and how to use eye contact right is a skill that anyone should have. And I found a lot of great tips and fun exercises included in this book to help you train your eye contact and make it better and more powerful. The exercises in this book are definitely worth looking into. For example, Robert teaches you how to take a shower by alternating the temperatures of the water to train your eye contact, which is a bit challenging and fun to experiment. I've learned so much about \"high-status eye contact\" and am convinced by the book that it is so important for everyone to have this type of eye contact whenever we want to deliver powerful and persuasive messages.\n"]], "rating_change": "", "video": "", "current_price": "", "count_customer_reviews": "", "previous_price": "", "image": ["http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51v1qso1auL._SS30_.jpg"], "category_path": "Kindle Store / Kindle Short Reads / 45 minutes (22-32 pages) / Self-Help"}

Proceed with caution if you have not read Divergent.', u\"It is no secret around here how big of a fan I am of Veronica Roth's Divergent.  I've lost track of how many times I have given out copies on this blog, and to friends in general.  It's one of those things that you love, and you really want others to read so they can love it as well.  Luckily for me, everyone who I have introduced Divergent to has enjoyed it.\", u\"The Transfer is a novella about the main character Tris's love interest Four.  I am not gonna lie, just typing the name Four makes me smile.  A friend of mine pointed out how much my face lights up when I speak about Four.  I just absolutely love him.  And if he were real, and I were a few years younger Tris would have to watch herself.  Four is strong, but he is sensitive and loyal to anyone he chooses to protect.  When I found out that there were going to be novellas written about Four, I was so excited.  I couldn't wait to get inside of Four's head and see what was ticking!\", u'One of the things I like about novellas is that they are usually optional.  While they are fun to read, they usually aren\\'t anything that you have to read to further the story.  Usually they are a behind the scenes story, or a way to get to know a lesser character.  It\\'s a way for an author and reader to have fun, and get to know a character better.  This is definitely the case with The Transfer.  Which tells a little bit of the beginning of Four\\'s story.  About his life before he was a Dauntless Initiate.  I\\'ve always wondered what exactly was going through Four\\'s mind when he chose Dauntless over the faction that he born in Abnegation.  I wondered how different Tobias was from \"Four\".'][u'As with all novellas, The Transfer made me want more!  Luckily there will be 4 other \"Four\" novellas coming out.  I know that some people have complained about the length of The Transfer, but I thought it was just enough to hold me over.  I think that\\'s what novellas are supposed to do, since they are usually released in between books.  It\\'s something to hold you over while you wait for the next book to be released.  And if this book did anything, it made me even more excited for Allegiant!', u'Reviewed by Sana @ Step Into Fiction']", ["\n  $1.99 is too expensive for a 30 page book but The Transfer is still worth it, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who reads the Divergent trilogy (can't wait for the third book)\n"]], "rating_change": "", "video": "", "current_price": "", "count_customer_reviews": "", "previous_price": "", "image": ["http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516N2mVnaZL._SS30_.jpg"], "category_path": "Kindle Store / Kindle Short Reads / 45 minutes (22-32 pages) / Teen & Young Adult"}

For 50\u00a2, a family got three postcard-sized prints from Disfarmer, a recluse who lived in quarters behind his studio and seldom mixed socially. Fifty cents was a lot of money to dirt farmers who were so poor that \"when the Depression came, they hardly noticed.\"", "Through pure chance, his portraits eventually came to light years after his death in 1959.

Classics of this magnitude, whether Adam Smith's THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, Tocqueville's DEMOCRACY IN AMERICA, or THE FEDERALIST PAPERS have achieved a status that makes the assigning of a rating rather silly.  Regardless of one's feelings about Marxism or Communism, a work of such gigantic influence is of such a status that rating it is almost silly.  It is one of the constitutive artifacts of our culture.\", u\"The particular edition I am reviewing is the recent reissue on Verso with an introduction by Eric Hobsbawm.  There are a host of editions of THE COMMUNIST MANIFESTO, and virtually any of them will do the trick, but I very much enjoyed this edition, partly for the handsome jacket and binding, and partly for the superb intro by Hobsbawm.  It is not a new translation, and indeed it isn't clear that there will ever be much of a demand for a new translation.  The MANIFESTO was first published in 1848 and this translation in 1888.  Moore's translation is the standard one for a simple reason:  Engels examined it closely and helped Moore in editing the final draft of the translation.\", u'Although I had read a fair amount in the writings of Marx over the years, this was my first time to read the work from cover to cover.  I found it surprising on several levels.  First, it was a much easier to read work than I had anticipated.  This is upon reflection hardly surprising.  The work was intended as a pamphlet for the masses, and it was essential that it be as understandable as possible.  Also, the concepts and ideas articulated in these pages have become a part of the intellectual landscape of Western civilization.'][u'  A host of ideas are commonplace, even among those who do not consider themselves sympathetic towards Marxism.  It has become a commonplace of the past decade that Communism and Democracy clashed, and Communism lost.  But the fact is that Marxist thought has exerted a massive influence on the way we view the world, and many things introduced by Marx are now central constituents of our world.  Just look at the way we write history now.  Before Marx a detailed consideration of the economic factors in an era was unheard of; now it is considered essential.', u\"As a credo, I find myself conflicted over its contents, just as I always find myself conflicted in reading Marx.  Marx's analyses of the dynamics governing capitalist society have always struck me as dead on.  No one writes more presciently or timelessly about the structures of exploitation that are inherent in capitalism.  Nonetheless, I find his positive proposals as to how to transcend capitalism to be untenable, and the post-capitalist world he describes to be undesirable.  The best way to express this is that I find Marx the critic to be convincing and impressive, but Marx the visionary to be irrelevant.  I want us to pay attention to Marx's critiques, but not to his proposals for change.\", u'I was delighted in reading the book to find the word \"highfalutin\" in the text.  The world seems somehow to be a more charming place for the unexpected presence of such a light-hearted word in the midst of a serious text.', u'Though listed as the work of Marx and Engels, Marx was the primary creator of the work.  He also did the bulk of the writing.  It isn\\'t sufficiently commented on what a beautiful writer Marx could be when he tried.  Too often he adopts the try academic style begun with Christian Wolff and continued by Kant, Fichte, and Hegel.  But a host of exquisite phrases such as \"All that is solid melts into air\" shows that Marx could turn a phrase when conviction didn\\'t prevent him.', u'Everyone interested in political thought or modern history needs to read this book.  Its influence--its ongoing influence--is incalculable.  Its critique of the exploitative nature of capitalism remains astonishingly relevant.  And its predictions about the future course of history, even if no longer inspiring or convincing, are crucial to grasp if one is to understand many of the political impulses of the past one hundred and fifty years.']", ["\n  I remember reading the Communist Manifesto thirty years ago when I was at University. At the time it seemed tedious and impenetrable. Recently I re-read it and was amazed at how clear it seemed and what an effective piece of propaganda it was and how clear was the writing.", "Reading through the program one realises the distance that has been travelled since it was written. Some of the major planks are the Abolition of Child Labour, the creation of a progressive income tax and Free Education.", "Perhaps one of its major weaknesses is that Marx was a person who tended to carry a grudge. Thus a third of it is devoted to attacks on some of his contemporary enemies and rivals. These disputes have so long passed into history they are incomprehensible.", "The modern notion of Communism of course stems not from Marx but from Stalin and Lenin. Marx wrote at a time when the only democratic country in Europe was France. England, Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire all had limited franchises and Russia was of course an autocracy.  One of the major reforms he battled for was the introduction of democracy. It was his belief that the implementation of his program would flow from that.", "Following Marx's death his movement evolved into a parliamentary movement the Social Democratic Party.  Communism as a modern political phenomena dates from 1917 when splinter Social Democrats followed Russia's lead and developed small conspiratorial parties who were committed to the seizure of power by force. Stalinism is an offshoot of this system and is a form of state terror aimed at ensuring the survival of unpopular anti democratic regimes.", "Reading through the Manifesto one can see the basis of a system which was not only an effective for mobilising political movements, but came to influence intellectual debate for the next century. There is also perhaps a sense of a naive optimism which could not contemplate the sorts of disasters which were to occur over the next hundred years.\n"]], "rating_change": "", "video": "", "current_price": "", "count_customer_reviews": "", "previous_price": "", "image": ["http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41-M6Rx4f%2BL._SS30_.jpg"], "category_path": "Kindle Store / Kindle Short Reads / One hour (33-43 pages) / Politics & Social Sciences"}

The first female British prime minister and one of the longest-serving prime ministers in Britain, she had acquired the reputation of unwavering dedication to the core conservative principles, and a steadfast way of implementing them through the public policy. Internationally she is also known, with Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II, as one of the main actors throughout the last decade of the Cold War that brought the end to the European Communism. It is exactly her firm and unapologetic repudiation of Communism in all of its forms that had earned her the moniker \"Iron Lady\" by her Soviet critics.', u'That passing of Margaret Thatcher earlier this year marked the end of an era. It also marked the revival of the many debates concerning her influence, policies and legacy that have been dormant for a while. This short Kindle Single, written by one of her most ardent admirers, is an attempt to put into a perspective many of the key aspects of her life and career. It is a fairly personal account that also manages to provide a wealth of information that many of us have forgotten, or were not as keenly aware of.', u\"Even though Thatcher's changes have had enormous impact on the UK policies and life, they have always had their more than fair share of detractors. Many of her critics to this day are all too eager to point to some failure - real or contrived - of her policies. However, as this short Kindle Single rightly points out, it's neither fair nor intellectually honest to criticize an essentially right-wing politician along the metrics of the left-wing desiderata.\"][u' What her opponents to this day consider to be her biggest failures are still things that have garnered her an enduring admiration on the right.', u'Nonetheless, Baroness Thatcher did have her share of failures and setbacks, something that she herself was always more than willing to acknowledge. Some of those were apparent while she was still working at 10 Downing Street, while the others are the unintended consequences of her policies that have only become obvious in the recent yeas. It\\'s these latter ones that this Kindle Single zeroes in. The gradual but unmistakable deterioration of the British social fabric can in a large measure be attributed to the unbridled individualism that has come to dominate the country\\'s way of thinking and can be traced to the economic and social changes in the 80s. In that light the title of this Single, \"Always Right,\" is not without its small share of irony.', u\"This is a very well-written and timely short introduction to the Iron Lady. It's a much-needed reminder of her greatest accomplishments and legacy.\"]", ["\n  Another great written book from Ferguson. Tells, the story with passion and exquisite detail.

The book starts out by explaining just exactly what game theory is and also breaks down a lot of the terms commonly used in regard to game theory.

As a preliminary, the author discusses the development of the Big Bang theoretical model of the universe as its credibility eventually overtook the prevailing Steady State model and was elevated to the Big Bang Theory in 1965 with the discovery of background radiation from the Big Bang. Physicists think they have a pretty good understanding of what has happened since about one ten-thousandth of a second (the author refers to this moment as \"time zero\") after the hypothetical singularity, and the author summarizes these events as the early universe expanded. He states that our knowledge of what has happened since that first ten-thousandth of a second is based on well-established laws of physics and backed up by experimentation.', u'So now the real question is: What kick-started the Big Bang, and what happened in those first tiny fractions of a second? The author states that what happened during the first split-second in the life of the universe is slightly less well established, but is still based on sound science. Try to imagine, as the author says, that \"everything we see in the observable Universe today was inflated from a seed less than a billionth the size of a proton to about the size of a basketball\" within a tiny fraction of a second. Only then did the Big Bang take over. It\\'s those first instants that the author recounts in this fascinating book.'][u\"In the introduction to the book, the author refers to the announcement in early 2014 that astronomers believed that they had detected the first direct image of gravitational waves within the cosmic microwave background. However, since that stunning announcement, doubts have arisen as to the astronomers' findings. In the last chapter, the author takes a closer look at this discovery and why it's so important if the sought-after gravitational waves have indeed been observed. A tantalizing idea: the Multiverse hypothesis could be tested if gravitation waves have actually been detected.\", u\"The book is not casual reading for most people. I'm intrigued by cosmology, and I have a technical background, but I won't even pretend to grasp all the concepts presented in the book. But John Gribbin is a first rate science writer, and he's distilled some incredibly advanced ideas about how our universe came into being into something that interested readers can at least partly wrap their minds around.\", u'Stay tuned, these are exciting times in astrophysics.']", ["\n  Gribbin recaps the big bang and outlines both what we have learned and amazing things cosmological science may soon confirm.  I feel well updated and some of my assumptions have thereby changed.\n"], ["\n  Perfect prologue to many of the excellent books on cosmology which typically begin with the Big Bang.

This Kindle e-book was a 140 Kb download (approx. 39 printed pages) and was priced at $1.99 at the time of writing this review.', u'Background:', u'1.) I\\'d previously read Biss\\'s account of the musical influence that Beethoven had on his life and musical career, in his work called \"Beethoven\\'s Shadow\". So when I saw he had another composer from the 19th century (Robert Schumann) as his latest endeavor, I was interested to see what he had to say.', u\"2.) Although I've no musical capabilities, I've always loved classical music... especially that of Beethoven. But Schumann was another case altogether... never liked his music as judged by the few pieces or small segments I've heard, before turning them off. So I was unsure of whether the examination of this composer would retain my interest or not.  It did... in spades!\", u'Some thoughts on \"A Pianist Under the Influence\"...', u'Written by a pianist and musician... only an individual with some degree of interest in musical history plus having the extraordinary abilities of a concert class pianist could ever undertake a project such as found in this short book... and so deftly pull it off.', u\"Author Biss takes great pains to make sure the reader is aware of the influence that the music of Schumann has had on him since age nine to present day. Although not really a history of Schumann's life (although there was the occasional reference here and there) this was rather a series of anecdotal accounts as to how his lack of social and communication skills forced him express himself in the one way he knew how... through his music. An appreciation that was not shared by many people...\"][u\" even some celebrated musical personage throughout the years to present day. These historical tibbits in turn, had a subsequent influence on the author's understanding, playing and intrepretation of his subject's compositions.\", u\"Rather than ramble on, I decided to use a few quotes from the book to reflect the author's feelings towards this often misunderstood and maligned composer...\", u'\"He (Schumann) writes music because it is the only form of speech available to him - his only voice.\"', u'\"It is the music (Schumann\\'s) I play at the end of the day, when my practice is completed, for no one but myself\"', u'\"Schumann\\'s music < > remarkably similar to loving a human being, in that even its flaws begin to seem life-giving, wondrous, revelatory.\"', u'\"But it is only with Schumann that it (music) becomes a diary as well. < > because Schumann\\'s music is a record of his private thoughts.\"', u'\"But why do we listen to music, if not because it says the unsayable?  < > that is what Schumann was after in his last works. The mix of tenderness and sadness is almost more than one can bear.\"', u'\"No one, before or since, has written music so personal, emotionally specific, and unflinchingly honest.\"', u'and finally... \"How beautiful he was, and how unfit for the world.\"', u'In 1854, an increasingly troubled Robert Schumann tried to commit suicide by throwing himself in to the Rhine River, but was rescued. He died two years later in an insane asylum near Endenich in 1856... he was 46 years old.', u'Conclusion:', u\"Not a book or an author for everyone... not only is this dry material but comes across as deeply subjective and philosophical from many points of view. However I loved it, and came away with a different appreciation for Robert Schumann. And although my limited musical talents (none... lol) still don't allow me to enjoy his compositions any more than before, it does give me some positive feelings towards a man that I'd have barely given a passing thought to before reading this.\", u\"I would have loved to learn a bit more about his relationship with his wife Clara and maybe a little more detail of Schumann's mental problems.\", u'As it is... 5 Stars.', u'Ray Nicholson', u'raynicholsonsreviews@hotmail.com']", ["\n  As someone who loves Classical music but is not a trained musician, I wish everyone who wrote about that music could do so with the insight and passion of this author. I've often felt distanced from Schumann for just the reasons Biss cites from his detractors--all that intensity without a discernable purpose, the lack (sometimes) of variation, and several other attributes familiar to anyone who has looked at a concert program and felt a little disappointed to see the name of Schumann.", "This opened the music up to me in ways I had not expected, and I'm going to try again, using some of the recordings that Biss mentions, including his own. I wish that Amazon had found a way to insert musical excerpts into the manuscript as links. As someone interested in the psychological implications of music and aware (although not always consciously) of its power over the psyche, I was fascinated by the idea of Schumann's baring his soul so unsparingly.  This book is highly recommended.Now on to Biss's thoughts about Beethoven.\n"], ["\n  This wasn't the pre-sleep wind down I was expecting -- not even close. As someone completely unversed in classical music (Romantic era composers, or otherwise), I was totally unprepared for the depth of my reaction to Biss's extraordinarily touching tribute to Robert Schumann.

But what really created a frisson of emotional excitement in me (actually two things) was the author's effusive, heartfelt expression of what the composer has meant to him since the age of nine (and I gotta wonder -- did Schumann's mama even love him this much?) and Biss's absolutely compelling descriptions of Schumann's music. (You WILL want to hear what the author hears, even if it is 1 A.M.) I can't recommend this enough.\n"]], "rating_change": "", "video": "", "current_price": "", "count_customer_reviews": "", "previous_price": "", "image": ["http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uCkffufyL._SS30_.jpg"], "category_path": "Kindle Store / Kindle Short Reads / One hour (33-43 pages) / Arts & Photography"}

Readers should not infer that poultry wire is the large-holed hexagonal chicken wire.  That wire is too open and too flimsy to use to protect your chickens.  Racoons will make short work of it. Though more expensive, invest in the half-inch grid hardware cloth and save yourself the expense and trauma of losing your birds to predators.", "Second, I would have liked to see some info on how smart and trainable chickens are.  There's a downside to that trait.  If you hear your chickens crowing one morning and as a result go out and let them free range or give them a treat, you have just trained them to crow every morning for the same thing again.

He repeated the commands, and the girls simply stood and giggled again.', u' \"If words of command are not clear and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly understood, the general is to blame. But if his orders ARE clear, and the soldiers nevertheless disobey, then it is the fault of their officers.\"  Upon saying this, he ordered the two concubines at the head of the troop, favorites of the emperor, to be beheaded.', u'The emperor hurriedly sent down the command to stop, he had no desire to see his favorites executed. The emperor said \"We are satisfied that the general knows how to command.\"', u'But Sun Tzu said, \"Once having received the commission, there are certain commands I am unable to accept.\" And he ordered the two favorites to be beheaded. Once again, he gave the commands. The concubines marched, whirled about and drilled in perfect order.

Things were heating up in many third world countries and covert intelligence agents were a genuine threat.", "In this story we see the amazing 'detecting' skills that kept Reacher at the top of his game.

Using his intuition and powers of observation, he soon learns the truth, but it's something far more sinister than a few leaks about a sniper rifle. And the truth could very well cost him his life as the story built to a suspenseful, violent climax.", "Prior to reading \"Deep Down,\" my favorite suspense thriller character was Nelson DeMille's John Corey. Now, John Corey will have to share the spotlight with Jack Reacher. The two characters are as different as night and day - Corey's wisecracking sarcasm contrasting sharply with the laconic Reacher - but both are memorable characters.", "\"Deep Down\" included an excerpt from Child's next full-length Jack Reacher novel, A Wanted Man.

Las Vegas provides the perfect setting for a December 24th ceremony and everyone they hold dear is in attendance. However, it doesn't quite go as planned.

And for anyone with an interest in mind control, and the power of the subconscious mind, you will find these books of great interest.", "Her second book \" How to make him Burn with Desire\" follows on from \"Pussy Whip\". You will also enjoy this book. And finally the third book, \"Pussy Power\" teaches you some of the things you have forgotten as a women, when it comes to finding you man, dating him and having him commit to the relationship.", "But please do heed her warning!

During the day I tried just the simple \"Pussy Whip\" technique. Within a few minutes I seriously had gotten a few text from the guy I was meditating on. I also got a video of him singing to me. I love watching him sing so it was special to me. Later that evening I got home and just knew that I was going to see him. Its been a little bit since I saw him but I knew he\\'s been extremely busy with work related and child related matters so I hadn\\'t pressed meeting up. I was determined that I was going to get a little bit of his time though. So I cleaned up my house, and just kept telling myself that he would be coming over. When I had a negative creeper thought come in like \"what if he is too busy tonight\", I busted that negative thought down by saying to myself that I am f\\'n awesome chick and he is going to want me like crazy.', u'I got into the hot bath and tried the second technique in \"Make him Burn with Desire\". I got out of the tub and started getting dressed and prepared for him to come over. I just knew he was not going to be able to go without seeing me. We usually text all day long, and today my phone was fairly quiet. It was like we had been talking all day subconsciously. Within a few minutes he was calling me and telling me that he was going out with friends from work but he needed to see me. Keep in mind, I have not seen him in a couple of days.'][u' I needed this man to know I am not a bootie call and I want commitment.', u'He got to my house fairly. I shouldn\\'t have been surprised but I was. I had made him want me so badly all day long ;). I didnt kiss him when he got there. In fact, I acted coy. We discussed work and other various topics and he told me he had a busy schedule for Friday and a meeting with the President of his company. He told me he wouldn\\'t be able to stay the night, I was kinda let down. Made me feel like even more of a bootie call. Shortly after, he straight up said he needed and orgasm. I  smirked and in a sexy tone told him I was alright. Ha ha silly man. He was shocked! I never turn him down!!! Never never never. I am always at his beck and call. Not tonight. I told him flat out \"I am not that kind of woman.\" I am not going to sleep with you if you aren\\'t staying the night. Sorry to you ladies who might think I am wrong, but have some damn standards. Set your man straight!!!!', u'He said that was alright and he really just wanted to spend some time with me. I know lol. We have a lot in common, not saying we are \"in love\" yet. He knows I love him. I know he loves me. When the time is right, it will happen.', u'I was laying seductively on the bed, staring into his beautiful eyes screaming to take me but my mind told my body that I want this man as my boyfriend and not a friends with benefits. So I did not sleep with him, touch his junk, give him head nothing. Two hours later I was walking him to his car. He said that we needed to get together soon. Of course I knew he meant \"stay the night and get his fullfillment\". Trust me ladies...I am hot for this man and it was hard to turn him down. I told him that I have a lot going on this weekend so he needed to let me know soon if he wanted to hang out. I lied. I don\\'t really have too much going on. But we are talking about high stakes here!! He said to me \"I am not seeing anyone else\". I about melted. This was great news. Not 100% commitment but we are on the way there. I said well I am glad to hear that. I said \"I am not sleeping with anyone else\". I am not letting him know I won\\'t be hanging out with anyone else. He needs to know I am a busy woman and can have my options. I told him that I might be hanging out with friends. He said, worst case scenerio I tag along with you. Excuse me lol???

If you have never meditated before try a self help book for that before this book. I think her technique for meditation needs a little bit more thought. You need to be very very relaxed to get into that mode. You also need peace and no noise or it will interupt your thoughts.', u'Good luck ladies!!!']", "[u'OK.

I'm actually surprised she can sell this book on Amazon because what she has written here can really change anything about anyone's life.\", u\"As I was reading this I realized that I kind of do this method already, unconsciously, when I am talking to people or need to get out of a sticky situation. For example, I'll get pulled over by a cop, and I will KNOW that I'll be able to convince the cop to not give me a speeding ticket - without him knowing I am trying to convince him. I've been caught driving out of state without a license and got off with a warning before...I've been hired for  a job where a college degree was required (which I do not have) and got hired anyway. I've always felt I had a gift for getting what I truly want from people, in certain circumstances. After reading this book, I realize that it is not coincidence or my good looks getting me out of speeding tickets...haha.\"][u' Now, I know exactly how to direct this \"mental energy\" into getting what I want. I cannot wait to put it into practice everyday.', u'I used this technique last night three times before I went to bed, and I fully expect what I want to happen, to happen. When it does, and it will, I will come to update my review. She says to give it 30 days but I really think it will happen quicker than that.', u'My only concern is that the subject matter may be too \"deep\" for some, and that most people won\\'t read the whole thing - which may be good, because if you are not at the maturity level to understand the subject matter, you are probably not at the maturity level to use this method for good, and not bad.', u'Thank you so much for writing this book Lanie!!

Radiant Angel is filled with all the suspense found in a good detective Adventure novel, and this Companion by Book Sense left no stone unturned. There were many minute clues and elements that were addressed in the Summary & Analysis, and the themes and symbols analysis enriched my understanding of the complex plot.

The feasts of trumpets points to the rapture and with the blood moons due to appear again next Sept. it is more than interesting.

I made a lean to from an old tarp to create shade where my youngest would nap for hours.  At the end of the day, we visited I a public bath house, showered off the sand & I dressed them in PJ' s for the hour drive home.\", u'In the years since, I have bought all of the things, or been gifted everything I used to think I wanted, needed or thought I was supposed to have.  But the strangest transformation began almost immediately after acquiring all the \"stuff\"  I began to stay constantly stressed over where to put things, surprised that I really didn\\'t love most of it and guilty to have been blessed yet ungrateful.  I couldn\\'t understand why, what was wrong with me?  Well, your book, along with a few others, smacked me in the head with the understanding:  I was perfectly NORMAL!  THE CONSUMER IN ME WAS THE CRAZY ONE!  Some books go to the extreme, but your book helped me define my own level of minimalism.'][u\"  I have completely decorated my sister's home with my rejects, I have made gifts of beautiful jewelry I never wear to friends and family and I no longer have ANY clothes I don't love or drawers overstuffed with stuff.  I plan to finish after the overindulgence of the holidays have passed, and bring exercise, meditation and real joy back into my life.  Thanks for the nudge I  the right direction!...\"]", "[u'Growing up, I never wanted for anything. I always had plenty of food, a good home, and a bevy of other niceties that I always thought were necessary parts of life. As I grew older, I realized I started placing so much importance in material items. I had to have the largest TV, the most lavish house, and all the latest gadgets. One thing I never really had, however, was happiness. At some point, I realized that these \"things\" weren\\'t good enough. I decided it would be a good idea for me to try to place less importance on stuff that didn\\'t amount to anything worthwhile. In my search for a simplified lifestyle, I came across Simplify. This book is filled with valuable information that really shows you exactly what you need and what is just unnecessary filler. Possessions are ultimately worthless in the grand scheme of things, and what\\'s most important is family, friends, and the good times you have.', u'On my journey for a decluttered lifestyle, I also came across 21 Things You Should Give Up To Be Happy. This is a book written from a similar point of view in which living with less actually gives you more freedom. It\\'s also not just about giving up material possessions. Many of the things listed in the book deal with deeper, more meaningful concepts that should be let go. For instance, one of my favorite chapters is \"Give Up Caring What People Think of You.\" I think one of the driving forces behind my need to get the latest and greatest gadgets was the fact that I wanted to impress my neighbors and friends. I think, a lot of times, we put too much stock in what people have to say about how we live, when we should really be focusing on what makes us happy.'][u'All in all, I think Simplify  and ', u' are great books for anyone looking to \"let go.\" There is no rule that suggests that happier people have more toys in their closet. I can attest that having a nice house with nice things doesn\\'t make you happy in the least bit. With the help of these books, my life has certainly turned a corner.']", "[u'I had not read a single post from his blog before purchasing this book.  I was in for a pleasant surprise.', u'  This book is extremely concise (less than a 100 pages), which I value in any blog post, article, or book on simplicity.  Quality over quantity.', u\"  Which brings me to the next point, this book is on PRINCIPLES (as indicated by the title of the book), meaning it will teach you how to fish instead of just handing out fish.  If you want someone to hold your hand, buy the Simple Living Guide (500 pages!) and she will direct step by step, dump your drawers out, separate into three piles kind of stuff.  There are many blogs on declutting, and Miss Minimalist and Zen Habits will walk you through.  There is no point in Joshua reiterating what countless others have covered in regards to clutter.  He is simply here to introduce to you the simple life, offering principles that you'll want to keep for a lifetime.  The benefits are immense.\", u'BOOK UNFOLDING:', u\"  Book starts out with his story.  I like the approach, makes you feel welcome.  His stories are insightful and entertaining throughout the book.  First story goes: some neighbor tells him about her minimalist daughter while he's spending time in the garage cleaning, yet another weekend gone.\", u\"  He boils things down to the top reasons why you should simplify your life.  He points you to his blog if you need more reasons.  I was delighted to see the bullet point about simplifying so your kids don't have to rummage through all your stuff one day!  Other minimalists don't touch on this important subject.  All the junk piling up in my mother's house --- I wonder how I will counter that monumental task if my dad passes or if some tragic accident happens to both of them.\"][u\"  It's not a delightful topic to think about, but it makes it easier on everyone if you prepare and figure out what really matters in life before you pass, not just for your sake, but for the environment and for your children.\", u'  Josh takes you through the pros and cons of capitalism.  You hear both sides.  There are pros and cons to everything.  Going green has cons like less-than-baby soft toilet paper or having to lug your empty water can around instead of drinking out of throw-aways.  When people write books about their ideas, they often leave the cons out.  I like his balanced approach.', u\"  He then takes you into budget making (critical for a life of simplicity).  His plan is the simplest I've come across.  He mentions (wisely) that you can't just put $400 for food, because it varies from month to month.  He implements savings and charity donations into his budget, so the rest left is free to spend.  He's on the money!\", u\"  The book covers these topics:  Find clutter magnet spots in your house.  Opt out of junk mail.  Turn hangers around when using a garment to get a clue as to what you actually use every month (brilliant idea!).  How to deal with simplicity with kids.  How to manage enjoyable gift exchanges (clever points here).  Buy quality.  Don't get addicted to anything.  Give.  Don't take short cuts.  Love things without owning them, love nature. Speak with integrity.  Manage time and your computer desktop.  Benefits of less TV.  (Basically, he reveals the right direction with innovative ideas to try immediately.)\", u'  He finishes the book off inviting you on this wonderful journey of less encumbrance with superfluous things...more time with people who matter.  Gives you a lovely family, Christmas portrait on the last page.', u'IN SUMMARY:', u\"  I enjoy how Joshua doesn't push his religious beliefs.  I am a Christian, but I still don't like to be preached to.  I did enjoy all the great quotes throughout, especially the one by Spurgeon.  My dad loves Charles Spurgeon!\", u\"  If you can't tell, I thoroughly loved this book.  I have read a great deal of books on minimalism, but nobody sums it up and packages this kind of life like Joshua does here.  Definitely worth having in your Kindle library.  I have reaped plenty from having less: mobility, time (to enjoy life), more savings, focus --> a satisfying career, stronger relationships, a greener lifestyle... The list goes on, and it will for you, too.\"]"], "rating_change": "", "video": "", "current_price": "", "count_customer_reviews": "", "previous_price": "", "image": ["http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41xOZMz2miL._SS30_.jpg"], "category_path": "Kindle Store / Kindle Short Reads / 90 minutes (44-64 pages) / Self-Help"}

It initially describes some of the lows he eventually fell to, \"One Sunday, we ran dry and made screwdrivers with rubbing alcohol.\" (Shubaly, 2011 pg. 8) but then what transpires as he realizes he needs to give that life up and start running is what makes the book interesting.', u'The book begins; describing his drinking troubles and various moves from Massachusetts to Colorado and eventually back to New York by way of Colorado again. Shubaly finally got his undergraduate degree.  It wasn\\'t easy for him though, as he describes \"More than once, I woke in the middle of the night, crying uncontrollably.....I got straight A\\'s.\"  So even though he was barely functioning alcohol, he still did well at school.  Later his plan was to either go to rehab or grad school.  He moved back to Manhattan with $300.  He applied to one school, saving his last $75 for the application, which ironically he had to use to pay for an open container ticket.  He paid it and then borrowed the application fee and lo and behold was accepted to Columbia University.  It is amazing that someone as screwed up as he is, was able to graduate with an undergraduate degree, let alone a Master\\'s.', u'Shubaly\\'s darkest period came about at this time. He moved onto songwriting and made a name for himself (sort of) and proceeded to up his addiction to various drugs - Oxycontin, Vicodin and Opana (a narcotic made famous by the movie \"Drug store Cowboy\\'s.)  The downward spiral continued.'][u'  His band played their last show; he was fired from a couple of jobs and lived with reckless abandon until he started hanging out with a bartender named Tracy, who was at one point a personal trainer.  She vowed to get him into shape.  In 2009, Shubaly made a vow.  \"I quit drinking, cold turkey.\" (Shubaly, 2011)', u\"This is when the book took the turn from a darker side (although his fight with sobriety had its own dark elements...maybe more so than his days he spent high and drunk)  He began to run.  He met a girl named Izgi, who supported his quest to run, but more importantly didn't make any judgments against him for his actions in his former life.  She supported him in his first run, a half marathon which he ended up finishing in 1:46:50 which really was quite good in his opinion.  He began to enter numerous more races a 50k where he met Luis Ramirez who was later to become a very good friend.  Shubaly did this run in a little over 5 hours.  Interestingly, during all these runs he entered, he met so many people who were recovering alcoholics, or someone who was escaping some sort of bad period in their life.\", u'It is interesting to note that his addiction to Alcohol and drugs was now replaced with his addiction to run.  His goal was to run further, harder and with more abandon.', u'People have said they get a \"runner\\'s high\" when they run.  This was the only thing keeping him from turning back to the bottle.  He visits a counselor, which he claims helps him.  He describes exercise as the \"Worst addiction ever.\" (Shubaly, 2011) but he can\\'t seem to stop doing it.', u'The book, after having read it, and then reading multiple reviews is quite misunderstood.  Yes, the book is called \"The Long Run\".  Is it about running?  Somewhat, but I think the author\\'s intent with the title is describing the long run through his life.  His life was painful.  It had many ups and downs, not unlike running.  Also, helping and supporting his friend Luis make it at the end of an ultra marathon adds a little feel-good twist to the story.

The history and actual goings-on of the show are usually dressed up and presented in the best light. The DVDs, commentaries, interviews, etc all portray the show as a wildly happy place, where everyone got along and made TV history. The only slight hiccup that sometimes pops up will be when someone, usually a cast member, will off handedly refer to Michael Richards as being \"quirky\" or \"different\", which by now I take to mean that he was a real a-hole.", "Stollers essay is funny, sad and perfectly introspective. It helps if you recognize him from the episode he guest starred, it makes understanding his personality a little easier. But, needless to say, Stoller didn't have the easiest time as a staff writer. He didn't mesh well with the other writers, Seinfeld and Larry David were too busy running the show to help guide him, and one jealous and insecure writer, referred to as \"Perry\", actively tried to sabotage his experience.", "In short, this is a great read for any Seinfeld fan. The inside look into the show is seemingly unbiased, reflective and realistic. It's totally different from the way the DVDs portrayed the show and the interpersonal relationships, but it isn't tabloid-y or seems like it was made for a quick buck. It certainly feels real and raw, and I think that is a rarity for any of the products that came out of the show. I ended up feeling bad for Fred, and I hope things stay productive for him. This essay was really quite touching.", "As a last question, I really want to know who \"Perry\" is. Stoller wrote for Season 6, and he names a lot of people, eliminating them. Berg, Schaffer, Robin and Kavet would have been the \"college kid\" writers, so that leaves Bruce Kirschbaum, Bill Masters and Bob Shaw as potential candidates. Personally, I'd probably lean towards Kirschbaum. Unless \"Perry\" never finished the script he was working on all year...\n"], ["\n  Super lean and all-funny prose makes Mr. Stoller's account of life as an actor/writer a total kick in the pants and a real pleasure to read.  There is literally no \"filler\" in this book, no sections that lag.  It seems to be constructed of  'only the good parts' -in a good way. The Sienfeld stuff really satisfies and is bookmarked by some of his experiences as a working actor told in a funny and very human way. Highly recommended.\n"], ["\n  Fred's account of his time as a writer on Seinfeld not only covers the emotions, struggles and triumphs of that writing position but shows glimpses of his family, his childhood and his personality. I wish this were, not just a Kindle Single, but an entire autobiography from birth to the present because it is refreshingly honest and impossible to stop reading. I can sense that there are countless stories and characters from Fred's life that are lurking just out or reach, beyond this downloadable snippet, that I'd gladly follow to embrace the honest laughs and the empathetic sighs. Some of the details and moments that Fred decribe are wonderfully woven with complicated emotions in one short narrative, one instance and sometimes even one sentence.

This is the comic that (sort of) revealed the origin of The Clown Prince of Crime, humanizing him to an extent never before, and truly examined -with pictures rather than words- the antagonistic symbiosis that exists between Joker and his arch nemesis, The Batman.  A beloved Gotham regular will never be the same and another will be put through hell before this story is done.  Oh, and there are creepy little henchmidgets as well.  Gotta love the henchmidgets.', u'The art is outstanding, the storytelling superb, and the character examinations are vital to understanding both combatants.  The \"one bad day\" premise highlights the \"two sides of the same coin\" argument that Batman and Joker are in fact more alike than dissimilar.  As if Bruce Wayne took a right when his arch-nemesis took a left.  The controversial ending leaves little doubt as to Alan Moore\\'s take on the debate, and I like it like that.  While many critics have strongly resisted both the comparison and the somewhat sympathetic look at The Joker\\'s past, the truth is that every great character -villain or hero- needs that sort of intricacy to their story to remain relevant in the world of modern fiction.  Comics are no longer for children and adults realize that the world is seldom black and white, that all monsters were once men, and that unspeakable darkness and insanity resides deep inside each human mind.'][u'  It can take years of suffering to bring them out or it can take one bad day.  One bad day could ruin your very existence and everything you were; it\\'s a frightening reality that cannot be overlooked while reading this comic.  The more the reader is willing to ponder the ideas put forth by this story, the more you are likely to appreciate \"The Killing Joke\".  An outstanding achievement in storytelling any way you look at it.', u\"I was tempted to knock this down to four stars because with this book you are buying a single issue of a comic for what you could easily pay for a full trade paperback or graphic novel of equal quality like, say, Frank Miller's \", u', which is so good it may very well cure cancer (can you prove it doesn\\'t?).  But the fact is no Batman fan should be without \"The Killing Joke\" and I would rather stick to reviewing based on quality rather than haggling over price.  The bonus story at the end (written and illustrated by TKJ artist Brian Bolland) is a killer little mini-comic that serves as a perfect companion piece to the main story and definitely sweetens the pot for those wondering if they should get this hardcover edition.  \"The Killing Joke\" is an absolute mindless must-have for fans of the comic book medium and even more so if you claim to be a follower of The Caped Crusader or his twisted nemesis.  End of story.']", ["\n  Batman: The Killing Joke is the greatest story ever told about the origin of The Joker.  What make this story so brilliant is how Batman, by accident, created his greatest foe.  The art in this story is perhaps Brian  Bolland's greatest achievement. (No one can draw The Joker better than  Bolland. ex: The cover of the Greatest Joker Stories Ever Told).  Alan  Moore delivers a dark story about Batman and his relationship with the  Joker.  From the first page when Batman visits The Joker at Arkham Asylum  on a dark stormy night, to exactly 24 hours later when Batman confronts The  Joker at an abandon carnival is brillantly told by Moore in the format of  The Dark Knight tradition.  I thought it was brillant to begin and end this  story with the same panel (rain falling on the ground) which shows no  matter what fates happen to everyone else, Batman and The Joker will always  end up where they started...\"There were once Two men in a lunatic  asylum...\" This one-shot format for mature readers is also exceptional  how it can merge two stories (Joker's origin and Batman's hunt for him)  together.  For example, When the Joker's hand is outstreched toward's the  clown in fortune teller machine, the panel before shows The Joker reaching  for his wife, with the same expression on her face...while his expression  is reflected in the backround.  It is almost as if he were having a  flashback to his orgin. It is also interesting to see Batman confront The  Joker and offer to help him, despite all The Joker has done.  On the panel  where The Joker glances at Batman before he says no to Batman's help is  very scary in the fact that The Joker is actually considering to accept  help from Batman.  I guess the best example of Batman's and The Joker's  relationship is on the back cover, with both of them on the same playing  card...Forever together and forever apart...like different sides of the  same coin...\n"]], "rating_change": "", "video": "", "current_price": "", "count_customer_reviews": "", "previous_price": "", "image": ["http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y817VtILL._SS30_.jpg"], "category_path": "Kindle Store / Kindle Short Reads / 90 minutes (44-64 pages) / Comics & Graphic Novels"}

It's a rather thin magazine, but what you get is lots of good, useful content that is similar to InStyle (minus the gobs of advertisements).  Stylewatch appeals to the readers of People magazine (which, I admit, I do not read) and fashionistas who enjoy reading up on fashion, trends and celebrities.  What I like about Stylewatch is that it doesn't waste your time with pages of ads, editorials or articles. It gives you pictures, pictures, and more pictures as well as a good look at current and upcoming trends and some great comparison shopping/tips for budget-minded fashionistas.  Instead of showing you gorgeous pictures of paper-thin models wearing outfits you couldn't afford, it shows you what celebrities are wearing and how you could wear a similar outfit for much less. It also gives you current trends and outfits in various price ranges, which makes it a magazine that proves that you don't have to make a million bucks to LOOK like a million bucks.", "I usually satisfy my thirst for fashion articles by reading Harper's Bazaar or Vogue, but for my quick-fix up-to-the-moment what-are-the-celebrities-wearing-these-days look at the trends, as well as my source for great fashion ideas and tips, I go to People Stylewatch and it never disappoints.\n"], ["\n  Say what you will about InStyle (which I subscribe to as well), I consider People stylewatch a better alternative if you are trying to choose between the two and don't happen to have a six-figure income.

They have a section on cheap chic - where they copy a designer look on a budget which I enjoy. So for frugal fashionistas, this is a great companion.

Though I usually have good intentions of finishing them later, more often than not, they get tossed in cleaning sprees before I accomplished that task. But with Style Watch, you can get a lot of info covered in a short amount of time and learn a lot; yet, if you don't get all the way through it before it's discarded, you still got your money's worth. In a nutshell, it's a thin magazine packed full of useful, interesting fashion tips, trends, new products, education, and pictures -- all without bombardment of ads or filler like in most other fashion publications. Just like it's parent magazine, People, the pages flow seamlessly. Perhaps Style Watch's greatest asset of all, in my opinion, is its appeal to women of most any generation: not an easy task to accomplish. Personally, I am the youngest of baby-boomers, but I enjoy the magazine as much as the twenty-something women I work with.

I'll be brief - don't worry about price; cost (rather than price) implies value atop price, and let me tell you the added value is well worth it. Besides the 5.1/7.1 ability (separating it from the lower tier model), is the fact that it is usable on X360, PC, and Mac, which is fantastic for me since I game on literally every modern platform. My PC gaming sessions, audio/video work on Mac, voice chat/calling, has been as great an experience as on my preferred gaming platform, PS3. I mention this because I've played with dozens of headsets over the years and nothing comes close. As far as making calls over Google Voice and Skype, the good news continues. The cords are quite long (at least 15 feet I'd say), which works well in my large living room. Set up was a breeze for me and will be for you. I mean, if you've connected a modern home theater set-up...come on, this is child's play.\", u\"The over the ear design is extremely comfortable and I barely notice having them on after several hours of listening. I love the independent controls for chat vs. the game, important for team play during multiplayer matches and MMO's. The bass is quite prolific and easy to control. Other reviewers likely couldn't figure out that you just need to lower it on the main unit, so you can adjust accordingly on the other control unit that you keep close to you during matches. From a gameplay standpoint the channel separation is just fantastic and it really does help in picking up attacks vs. a non-surround set-up like my previous 3 channel soundbar. I had a 5.\"][u\"1 setup in my old house and I can tell you that now that I've gone DPX21, I would never go back to gaming with a traditional 5.1/7.1 external speaker setup. It's just needlessly disruptive for those around you and totally unnecessary. The experience with this headset trumps any setup I've experienced in my home or in any friends' homes. I don't know what it is, but I usually feel underwhelmed in some way by most setups - either by weak sound, inconsistently delivered volume on separate channels, or when they're properly powered and loud the reverberation in the wall or some other factor takes the cleanliness from the sound, not to mention it's usually bugging someone somewhere. I really can't say much else, other than to buy this gem of a product and you'll be happy (as will housemates).\"]", ["\n  WOW as soon as I put them on I was blown away.

Also, in case you were wondering it works great on PS4, no extra cables needed. I assume Xbox One is the same way. One small note, the adjustable part on my band is cracked, but I am pretty sure this is because I dropped them, not because they are bad. Also, someone explained in the comments that he believes the left ear cup issues are a result of the breakaway cable. So try switching that out before replacing your entire headset. I am bumping this review up to 3 stars, because the sound of the headset, and features are great. Also, I can see now that the ear cup issue wasn\\'t a \"regular\" occurrence, because I\\'ve had this set for about 2 years with no problems. Thanks everyone', u\"IMPORTANT UPDATE: 5-23-2013 Like many others, my left ear cup went out. I didn't drop them, never mishandled them in anyway, always took the best care of them, and yet the ear cup still went out. Turtle Beach promptly responded to my issue with an RMA request. They didn't try to troubleshoot it at all (because they know its an issue I assume). So I sent my XP Seven back to them. To their credit, the RMA process was very quick and easy. I received a brand new headset about a week later. While I am happy to have a brand new headset, I am worried this problem will happen again and again. I guess they will just keep replacing them until my warranty is up. Anyway, the entire process has left a very bad taste in my mouth. THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN WITH A $250-$300 HEADSET. I am leaving my review at 2 stars, because I absolutely love the headset when its working. I think its amazing. But an inherent flaw as bad as this can't go unmarked.\", u'Intro: This is an unbiased review.'][u' I have used other Turtle Beach, Astro, and other audiophile headsets.', u\"The XP Seven is Turtle Beach's new top tier wired headset. While much of it is the same as before, it brings some new things to the table. Is it worth it? Read below and decide for yourself\", u'PRESENTATION/ACCESORIES: The XP Seven comes in a very nice box. It is very well packaged. It  appears to be a quality headset from the moment you open the box. It comes with every cable one would need for hooking up to your Xbox 360, PS3, PC/MAC, and any standard mobile device like Ipad, Vita, Iphone.  (this includes a specific cable that comes with the standard mp3 player controls on the cord, nice!).', u\"COMFORT/BUILD QUALITY: This is the most solid TB headset I have ever held. It doesn't feel quite as solid as Astro A40's, but it comes pretty close. The memory foam feels better than that which is on the TB Tangos. The headset is pretty tight on my head, but I have a pretty big head. However, it isn't so tight that it bothers me, even after extended gaming sessions. I have kept it on for hours and been completely fine. When I put them around my neck (when I take them off) they pretty much strangle my neck, which is uncomfortable, but not really important. Although at first my ears seemed a little warm after wearing them for extended periods, I don't even notice it now. I am completely satisfied with the comfort so far. On that note, I think Astro A40s are a bit more comfortable. (this isn't an A40 comparison review, I am just trying to give a popular benchmark)\", u\"SOUND: It's the best TB headset I have ever heard, and I have tried all of the top tier ones. Everything comes through clearly. It is definitely as good as the A40s in this area. Some people have noticed the sound doesn't seem to go very high. They are right. It doesn't get SUPER loud. However, it does get plenty loud enough for me, which is saying something, because I like things louder than most. This setting can probably be adjusted through the Advanced Sound Editor, but I have yet to try.(SEE UPDATES BELOW FOR VOLUME SOLUTION) You can independently adjust game and chat volume, which is great. There may be one minor sound problem though. Refer to the problems section.\", u\"MIC: Works great. It's detachable. It's very flexible and can be positioned exactly where you want it. My friends say I sound great. The optional mic monitoring is great, (this is real mic monitoring, not a joke of a mic monitor that Astro claims to have) but if you don't like it, you can turn it off on the fly. The presets to make your voice change are also very fun. Very useless, but very fun.\", u\"FUNCTIONALITY: This is what sold me on the headset. The ability to plug them into anything you want. As I game on multiple platforms, this was an absolute must for me, and the XP Seven delivers completely. I have used it successfully on Xbox, PS3, PC, iPhone and iPad. When using for mobile, you obviously don't have to take the Audio Control Unit with you; just grab the mobile cable and your headset and you are good to go.\", u\"FEATURES: The main seller of this headset is the Audio Control Unit that comes with it. It comes with tons of presets for game volume and chat. I have mostly been using the standard ones, but having the option to tune it exactly how you want through the Advances Sound Editor is great. I have tested it, and it does work with the current Advanced Sound Editor available at the TB website. The ACU also allows you to plug in an MP3 device or phone to use while gaming. Never miss another call from your Mom or Girlfriend. Bonus! The adjustable surround sound angles are pretty neat as well, since everyone's ears are different. I have been testing surround sound through COD Zombies, and it's working great. They ACU has lots of little features like mic mute, mute all, running sound through your speakers as well as the headset, and more.\", u\"This is also the official MLG headset which is good I guess? I don't really care about MLG, but if you are into that sort of thing, then great. This brings me to my next point...TB plans on having customizable speaker plates in the future. I plan on taking advantage of this ASAP, as I don't care for the look of the currents ones with the MLG tag and all.\", u'FINAL VERDICT: I love it so far. If you need the cross platform capability, get this or the OLD AstroA40\\'s (the new ones are a mess, trust me, I owned them). The sound on these isn\\'t going to blow you away (unless you\\'re coming from weak TV speakers or something), no gaming headsets sound is really going to be amazing compared to some audiophile headphones. But they sound pretty dang good regardless. Yes the Sevens have a hefty price-tag, but if you\\'re  a big gamer (especially one who could utilize these elsewhere like in the car or with an ipod) I would say it\\'s worth the price. If you just need a headset for one console, or you want wireless, this probably isn\\'t the headset for you. (note: I have tested other TB headsets (like the Tango) on PC, and while it does \"work,\" it doesn\\'t work nearly as well as the XP Seven does.', u'--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------', u'UPDATES: I will update this review as needed with any new problems, any fixed problems, or any other relevant developments. Hit up the comments with any questions, and I will do my best to answer you. Enjoy the headset!', u\"UPDATE 2/7/2013 LOW VOLUME SOLUTION: A lot of people are very confused about the max volume of this headset. They are right, at stock settings, it doesn't get super loud. This is because TB included a feature where you can manually adjust the volume of each surround sound speaker. So, to make your headset louder, each individual volume needs to be turned up. To do this, hit the 5.1 button. Each time you hit this, it will switch to a different speaker set. You need to hit this button, then you will see the speaker indicator lights come on, then turn your volume knob up. You need to do this for each speaker. This will make your headset MUCH louder. Credit for this goes to OLGC2977 on YouTube. I have heard reports that the headset is no longer shipping with the volume turned down, so this may not even be an issue still.\", u'UPDATE 2/9/2013 AUDIO DROPOUT SOLUTION: I mentioned above that on low volumes my audio would cut in and out. I fixed this by adjusting the \"Threshold\" which you can find under the \"Silencer\" section of the current preset you\\'re using. This is done through the advanced sound editor. While this has solved 90% of the problem, there is still an occasional game where the sound drops out. Annoying, but not a big deal.', u\"Still wondering if this headset is for you? Just a note, stores like Gamestop have a different return policy for their headsets than they do for their games. You can buy them and return them no questions asked within 7 days, and within 30 if it breaks. If you're trying to decide between this and another, buy both and return one! (I love Amazon, and their return policy is great, but alas, you do have to wait for shipping)\"]"], "rating_change": "", "video": "", "current_price": "$88.89", "count_customer_reviews": "135 customer reviews", "previous_price": "$149.95", "image": ["http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51lcw9nV9iL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41zloN4-SRL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51qSgI4XT8L._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41vwKXtizeL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41uh1o0CKXL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51wNgZsCciL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg"], "category_path": "Electronics / Video Game Consoles & Accessories / PlayStation Vita / Accessories / Headsets"}

Good luck downloading Uncharted on one game card, or BlazBlue, it's not worth paying 65 and 55 bucks to be able to avoid physical media taking up half your card. And the Tester videos, just watch them on your PS3 or get a 32GB card.\", u'They really need to release higher capacity cards, 32GB is plenty for a lot of downloaded content, but thank god for physical media so you can get more for your Memory Cards. However I am not a fan of wasting bandwith and having to delete/download constantly and I hate buying multiple cards to get around this, 8GB should be plenty for most casual gamers that do not plan on putting any games from the PSP, especially if you are going the physical route for Vita games.

Don't believe the line in the description that says it holds \"2-4\" Vita games. That's pretty low, actually, based on an average of 2 to 4GB per game, which is very high. I've had a chance to peruse the actual sizes of Vita games available on the Store, and they really range from 1 to 2 GB generally, with a few big ones up above near 3 to 4, but these are rare. There are also some smaller scale games that range around 200 to 500 MB. So realistically, I think the 8GB card could hold around 5 to 7 games, not 2 to 4.", "About the card itself, it's a memory card. What's to analyze? It's very very small. Smaller than a penny, really.

For this much money, you can buy a decent 120GB SSD.  But I digress.  This card will display 59GB when you look at its storage capacity on the Vita itself.  I've included an explanation at the end of this review on why your card will read 59GB when you put it in.  For those of you who don't want to read all of it, 59GB is what is displayed and this is not incorrect, nor is saying that it is 64GB wrong, it's just a common deceptive practice in today's digital storage market.\", u\"This card, despite being a Japanese import, works just fine on American PS Vitas.  What you are buying is a direct Japanese import, not a card that's been localized for North America.  I'm using it on my NA PCH-2000 and I've played games from it, it works just fine.  The amount of data on this card makes it a far better deal than all the other cards, and you'll never realisitcally fill this thing unless you're a Vita junkie and have a ridiculous number of games from PSN downloads.  I put 5 PS Vita games (Borderlands 2 with all DLC, Gravity Rush, Uncharted, Soul Sacrifice, and WipEout 2048) and 3 PSone classic games (Front Mission 3, FFVII, and FFVIII) on here and it's only taken up 9GB of space.  You can get by on the 32GB card, but I'd rather not have to worry about disk space, especially for a relatively minor increase in price comparatively speaking.  Swapping cards is frustrating on PS Vita, mainly because it requires you to completely reboot, it's nothing like PSP.  However, that's on the Vita's end, not this card's.\", u'An explanation on digital storage sizes:', u\"The card holds 64GB measured in metric units as opposed to binary units.  What's the difference you ask?\"][u'  This is a fairly common practice that many people misunderstand.  This thing will display 59GB to your console, despite the fact that it is in fact 64GB.  Why?  It\\'s not because 5GB is allotted to \"formatting\" (it doesn\\'t take 5GB to do that).  64GB is measured in metric units, meaning it is measured as 64 billion bytes, since giga- means billion.  In computer architecture, measurements are based on binary units, meaning each power of 10 is actually 10 bits, which is 2^10 = 1024 Bytes = 1kB.  Expanding this, 1MByte = 1024kBytes =  1,048,576Bytes, and 1GB = 1024MB = 1,048,576kB = 1,073,741,824Bytes in binary units.  However, in metric units, 1GB = 1,000,000,000Bytes.  The difference is then 1,000,000,000/1,073,741,824 = 0.931, so metric measurements allow them to display sizes that are actually 7% smaller.  If you do the math, 0.931*64GB = 59.6GB, so it\\'s 64GB in metric (what they write), 59.6GB in binary (what the computer reads).  This is a common business practice and is how literally every form of digital storage is marketted nowadays.']", ["\n  I feel that I should write a review on this due to the other review posted that was negative.  1st off the card works great, the card doesn't offer a full 64gb of memory but it does give 59gb.  I ordered this from japan and it arrived shortly and works great on the American vita models, it has all of the space I need and more.", "In reference to the other person who feels that the card costs as much as the system, someone probably ordered a few and is raising the price by a large margin.  These cards will only cost about $100 when they are released in the USA, the one card available through amazon prime is setting prices that are unreasonable, $175 is far too much however I was able to get one for $125 through Hananoiro Shop.", "If you need the space then I would say to get this card, if anyone has any questions please feel free to ask.", "P.S.

If you are new to Turtle Beach headsets or just unsure about how they name their products. Anytime you see PX or a combination of that the P stands for usable on Playstation, X for Xbox so PX means it will work for both systems.

I own a Logitech G35 7.1 surround sound headset for my PC, and I absolutely love it.  Being a PC enthusiast gamer the ~ $125 price tag was justified at the time, and it was worth it considering how much it added to the experience.  I built my current PC a few years ago when I felt the PS3 and Xbox 360 were overdue for next gen, and before that I had never thought about getting a quality headset for console gaming.', u'Enter the next gen systems with PS4 and Xbox One.  What really spurred me to want to look into console gaming headsets was the fact that the PS4 makes it so easy.  I just had one requirement- something with a 3.5mm jack to plug into the DS4.  I did some research and found lots of people commenting on their current Turtle Beach headsets and how many were working fine on the PS4.  My Logitech G35 actually works fine on PS4 plugged into USB, but the sound quality of the G35 in stereo is not great.  I also wanted something that would work with the Xbox One as well.  The X1 controller has a proprietary headset jack on the controller now, but they announced that they would be releasing an adapter.  So I aimed for a Turtle Beach pair for PS4 compatibility, future Xbox One compatibility, and based off of all the positive reviews I had read about them.', u\"The PX22 fit the bill.  Its a universal headset with an inline amp that is advertised to work on PS4 and Xbox One (audio only), so the flexibility was a plus.  I also snagged it for a great price, on sale for $55 (retails for $80).  For the price, I really don't think you could find a better performing gaming headset.  For the PS4, I'm just plugging the detachable 3.\"][u\"5mm cable from the headset directly into the DS4 controller.  It works great, you can adjust audio levels in the PS4 OS.  For the Xbox One, I'm using a Digital to Analog converter from the optical connection in the back of the console, and I'm using the inline amp and plugging the 3.5mm headphone cable into the DAC.  I'm getting game audio, and the headset comes with an Xbox 360 chat cable that plugs into the inline amp (and then into the 360 controller) that I'm assuming will work with the yet released Xbox One adapter.  So I will be covered for chat in the future, no worries there.\", u'SOUND QUALITY:', u\"The sound quality of this headset really blew me away.  I wasn't expecting much honestly, I had read mixed reviews on the sound quality before purchasing.  Honestly, after hearing this headset first hand I do not understand the negative reviews at all.  The sound quality on Xbox One using the inline amp is outstanding.  The directional sound is incredible in Forza 5, I can hear cars coming up from behind for the pass, and I can hear which of my wheels is losing traction.  I've found that increasing the bass slightly on the inline amp gives the best mix.  The bass is excellent on these headphones, its much more hard hitting than the bass on my Logitech G35s even at the default setting.  The clarity of sound is also very good, much more clean than any headphones I've used previously.\", u\"On the PS4 plugging into the DS4, I've found that the sound quality does not suffer at all without using the inline amp.  Its still just as awesome, you just lose the ability to alter treble and bass and mic volume.  What's great is that the DS4 basically makes these into a wireless headset, since all you need to do is plug into the controller.  I've used these on AC4, NBA 2K14 and Killzone Shadow Fall and have been really impressed.  I'm hearing lots  more detail in AC4 including footsteps, rustling of leaves and bushes, and the ambient music soundtrack that I didn't even realize was there before listening through these headphones.  They really shine for a shooter like Killzone Shadow fall, the amazing directional sound adds to the immersion and also helps you play better.\", u'I also tried these on my PC to compare to my G35 7.1 pair, and I was really impressed with the results.  Despite the fact that these are only stereo, I actually felt like the directional sound was better on the PX22s than the G35.  Its probably because the overall sound quality is just better.  The bass is especially noticeable, makes the explosions and rumbling tank sounds in BF4 even more immserive.', u\"Overall, I'm really impressed with the sound quality.\", u'ABOUT WIRES:', u\"The PX22s are a wired headset, and depending on how you are using them, there can be a lot of wires going on.  With the PS4 its essentially wiress with just the headphones connecting to the DS4.  However on Xbox One, once the adapter releases my setup will be the headset plugged into the inline amp, which is plugged into the DAC from the optical cable out the back of the console with a USB split at the end plugged into the console's USB port, and then also an additional chat cable from the inline amp leading to the X1 controller adapter.  Its really only an extra cable with the chat cable, but those who hate lots of wires should probably steer clear.  On PC you would need to plug the inline amp into a USB port, and use a headphone and mic splitter to plug into your sound card.  Its more annoying than a simple USB headset like I have with the G35, but its not that much of a mess.  I think the complaints about all the wires are overblown...setup is really simple, and all of the options allow this headset to be truly universal.\", u'BUILD QUALITY:', u\"I've seen a lot of complaints about build quality.  I'm really not sure why.  I think my G35s are better built quality for sure, but I also paid over double what I paid for the PX22s.  I don't find the build quality of the PX22s to be bad at all, the material used on the ear pieces feel fine against my ears, the headband has leather coverings, and the mic feels pretty solid.  The wiring is relatively thick and doesnt tangle easily.  I also don't have any problems with the headset being tight as other reviewers have said, it feels just fine on my head and is perfectly comfortable.\", u'TL;DR', u\"Excellent sound quality, works on PC, PS4, and Xbox One for audio with chat in the future.  Directional sound is the best I've heard from a stereo headset.  Comfortable fit, wires might be a turn off for some.  For the price, I'm really happy with this headset.\"]", "[u'First a quick PS3 game system use review:', u'I love this headset! The cable is a total of 17 FEET from the USB end to the headset, plenty of room to either sit as far away from the TV as you want, or to hide the cables to keep everything neat.', u'The unit looks nice, black with blue stitching. The ear pads are nice and comfy AND vented(the blue plastic has tiny holes in it).', u\"The top of the headset is cushioned and thinner than PS one, it also has a nice tilt - it so it doesn't lay on your head if you don't want it to -even after several hours playing Borderlands 2 I barely noticed them on.\", u'It has separate bass and treble controls so you can tailor the sounds to just the way you like and it. These have a nice sound to them it sounds clean and crisp and you hear a nice *thud* when you expect it - really really nice. Besides a master volume, On the chat side it has separate chat/game volume setting and also \"Dynamic Chat Boost\" that raises the chat during loud gameplay (explosions firefights, etc..)', u'The unit is 100% powered by the USB, no extra batteries/charging, it uses the PS3 Multi-cable (or the Xbox 3609 Audio adapter cable).', u'another cool point -The RCA jacks allow the headset to put them INLINE, so you can hook them up AND still have the sound running to whatever they were running to previously (the TV, sound system, Surround sound, Amp whatever...)- no need to have set up for either one or the other.. nice touch!', u'Basically once you are set up, you are good to go!', u'Basically many people love wireless headsets, (I do also, and have the Basic Sony PS3 Model) but they do seem to have a bad habit of dying at *just the wrong time*.', u\"These are a great addition if you already have a cordless set.. and if you don't have any headphones?\"][u' Get these first! :)', u'Really nice!', u'*****', u'Jim', u'More detailed review w/iPod use reviewed:', u'As stated above, these are very comfy and sound GREAT. I had these on (playing Borderlands 2) and totally was immersed in the game.', u\"I have a pair of PlayStation Cordless Headphones (the 7.1 virtual surround model) and they work fine, but the battery dies after a while.. nice to have a cabled model to just plug in and not worry about it, so that's where these come in.\", u\"Last night I was on for a pretty long time, was also online in coop mode so I was trying the chat also. The Mic is on a swivel with a goose-neck.  You can control your volume as well as others as on other models, but on this one it's pretty cool how the voice levels adjust to when the gameplay is quiet, but when it is loud (during firefights or other loud sequences) the chat volume also gets louder, so you aren't yelling, (and you can still hear others clearly). I tried it on Borderlands 2, there isn't as much talking as in other games, but I am sure you will find pretty cool also!\", u'Sound wise, these have more of a \"left/right\" sound compared to a surround model, but these have a better *sound* to them since you can adjust the boost and treble. It just sounds clean and crisp and You hear a nice *thud* when you expect it - really really nice.', u\"The cable from the USB to the controls is 14 feet, then you plug the headphones into it, and that is another 3 feet (of much thinner cable) so yeah, you have oodles of cable. I use it with a PS3, I also tested it with an iPod (7th gen Nano) for this all you do is unplug it from the control and plug it into the iPod like any other headphone. You use the iPods equalizer & volume and it sounded great, no problems no over-driving.

When they came in I tested them to make sure I was not giving him a faulty gift.  I tested them on both NBA 2K14 (the park) and on Tomb Raider as well as COD: Ghosts.  After using them for a couple of hours, I had to get a pair for myself.  I have read comments about the volume being bad, being faulty or unreliable, and not for adult heads.  I have experienced none of those issues.  I have a pretty large head, 7 3/4 in a New Era hat, and they adjusted to more than my head would need.  The volume is excellent.  I played my games with the volume wheel turned at about 50% and at some points in the game it was too loud.  The bass in headphones is pretty good.  It is  major upgrade from the ridiculous headset that comes with the console and is better than TV speakers by far.  I wouldn't  doubt that the $100-$350 headsets sound amazing and blow this one out of the water.  However, for $30 you cannot beat this headset. I would recommend it to anyone that is wanting to get a good product for little money.  If you are expecting 7.1 surround sound out of this headset, you will not find it.  Expect to spend a lot more money for that.  For the price though, it is a great product that enhances the sound of the game and adds some decent bass to explosions, gun fire, etc.  I would recommend this product.\n"], ["\n  I just recently had misfortune come upon my kunai with my satan cat. Any how I couldn't afford another $80 headset, so desperate times come in desperate measures (I may got that wrong a tad bit) I decided to buy the Kama for $26. Now I can say right off the bat I can tell the cheapness of this headset with the materials as the headset itself. I can also say that this is okay with me the quality is just fine and it works just a well even better considering I have a 4 now and can use the headset hassle free. The headset is a easy plug in jack right into the ps4 controller on the cord there is a volume for the chat. Unfortunately there is no volume for the mic itself for the Kama. I myself find it pretty easy to play games and chat at the same time with all audio going through the headset. If you don't like doing this you can always go into the audio settings for the ps4 and go to audio and change that to chat only for the headset. Also the mic in this one is not removable like other Tritton headsets. However if you do buy this I hope you enjoy it just as much.\n"], "[u'I had been searching for a back-up headset for my Astro A50, in case my battery would die in the middle of a gaming session, but I also didn\\'t want to brake the wallet either and so I opted for this headset. WOW! I could not be happier. Set-up is easy, you just plug it into your PS4 controller, go to your console settings, then devices and then select whether you want \"all audio\" or \"chat only\". (if you select \"chat only\", you will only hear the chat through the left ear cup, the one with the mic on it) Considering the price tag the audio is really good and the chat is crystal clear. While using it for both game and chat audio I didn\\'t have an issues with one over powering the other. The mic works very well at picking up your voice not the background noise. Boom mic is adjustable which allows for quick and easy adjustment to your mouth. Comfort is superb! I personally prefer \"over-the-ear\" headsets but this headset makes it work. (this headset is \"on-ear\"). I have a fairly large head and ears and yet had no discomforts even after four straight hours of gameplay. The headband expands for adjustment and it also has numerical values for each adjustment setting which is really neat specially if you have kids that could mess around with them or if you share the headset. The padding on the headband and the ear cups is soft and very comfortable. Also the headset does a very good job at eliminating sound leak and noise cancellation. So when you put them on any outside noise will be almost drowned out if not entirely and anyone around you won\\'t hear your gunfire or music outside of your headset, this was very surprising and pleasing for me considering the price. One thing to point out is that the mic is not removable nor does it flip upwards, all you can do is move it.'][u' Make no mistake though, this is no deal breaker. I have two pairs (one black, one white), one for me and one for my girlfriend. All in all this is a great headset and a very satisfying purchase. Whether this is your first headset or a back-up headset, this is a must-have for any gamer out there.']"], "rating_change": "", "video": ["http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/B1QDLrNPIgS.mp4"], "current_price": "$29.99", "count_customer_reviews": "328 customer reviews", "previous_price": "", "image": ["http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Wp4LgzQmL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Pbl1mwedL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41OoDwY1K0L._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Eynp2uP4L._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/419N-hkapyL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/91b-s1fjVLS._SX35_SY46._CR0,0,35,46_PImini-player-shuttle-50px,BottomLeft,-7,12_.png"], "category_path": "Electronics / Video Game Consoles & Accessories / PlayStation Vita / Accessories / Headsets"}

I wasn't abut to leave a $250 system out and about for it to collect scratches. But I also didn't want to pay $20 plus for some case. So I found this one for $10. It gets the job done. Here are some details I'm sure you're wondering about it.", "1. Fits nice and snug you don't have to worry about it rattling around in there.", "2. The case is hard and sturdy, I'm pretty sure I could drop it and the Vita inside would be just fine.", "3. Yes there are 2 annoying straps inside that might mess around with the analog sticks, but you don't have to use them", "4. Mine didn't have a smell as some other people have complained about, luck of the draw I guess", "5. I like the fact it has the sleeve inside that protects the screen and you can put some games in there to carry around.", "My only advice is if you don't like the straps and aren't going to use them I suggest cutting them off like I did, see when you put the Vita on top of the straps and go to unzip the case, since the Vita is kinda being held up by the straps it could easily slip if you're opening the case at an angle.

A few notes:", "- The case shipped to me does NOT have any sort of weird smell.  Another reviewer reported theirs did.", "- The two straps used to keep the Vita in place can certainly be slightly annoying, but they absolutely hold the device in place well.  I'm undecided on snipping them off or not.", "- Other reviewers reported that the games would slide out of the sleeve easily -- I did NOT find this to be the case, and I tried -- hard -- to make it happen.", "- Construction of this case, overall, seems very good.  Some of the stitching isn't perfect, but for under $9, it's impossible to complain about.", "To be perfectly honest, I think this case is better than the felt sleeve that came with my PSP1000.  I feel confident in saying the case could be dropped from a fair hight and no harm would come to the Vita inside.", "So far, I'm overall extremely pleased with the case and will put it through some usage over the next few months.  Should my opinion change at all, I'll be sure and update this review.\n"], "[u\"I had read other reviews regarding this product... some reviews stated that the case had a really pungent odor that was so bad that the product needed to be returned. This was not the case with mine & it was the first thing that was paying attention too when I opened the package. I sniffed around the box before opening & it didn't smell so I pulled open a corner & still didn't smell anything... I pulled it out of the box & took a HUGE wiff right on the case... nothing, just the normal weird from factory new fabric smell... I don't even smell that anymore & I have had it for a week or so now.\", u'The other thing people complain about the elastics inside that hold the Vita in place. people have cut these off as they do not like them... this I feel is a preference, I personally like them. They stretch enough that I can get the Vita out without to much difficulty or damage to the system. They are tight enough that they hold the system in place comfortably. People say they tug on the analog sticks when they try to  take the system out of the case but I dont find this to be an issue. I pull up on the elastic while grabbing the bottom corner of the system & put the elastic behind that side of the system I then lift the other elastic & slide out the system towards the side I already pulled the elastic off of. So again this is preference as to whether or not you want to snip them out.', u'The case itself is nice quality & I feel if I dropped it from about waist high no damage would come to my Vita. The flap inside has space for a few games &/or Memory Cards... however I do find that these slots are a little to big for the Memory Card alone without some sort of small case (like what the SD Cards come in)... games have no issue fitting.'][u' There is a netting on the inside as well for small accessories... but not the AC adaptor... maybe a USB Cable and some ear buds are all that would fit. I personally have not used this section yet.', u'All in all I find this to be a good purchase for the price as it is good quality, I feel it protects my system, & like that it has some space for some games &/or Memory Cards.

The back of the protector has an indentation as well where the rubber grips are on the naked system. I haven't applied the screen protector provided with the pack though since I've already purchased the 'HORI Screen Protective Filter for PlayStation Vita 2000' literally 2 days before I even saw this product available.. I'm sure the protector works the same way since its the same company, just seems to be a different application process. All in all, I'm very happy with this purchase and recommend it to anyone looking to protect their system.\n"]], "rating_change": "", "video": "", "current_price": "$19.98", "count_customer_reviews": "32 customer reviews", "previous_price": "$19.99", "image": ["http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PqIB4QuoL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41kF9J1oNHL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg"], "category_path": "Electronics / Video Game Consoles & Accessories / PlayStation Vita / Accessories / Accessory Kits"}

It also weighed quite a bit more and had no electronics (it was literally a molded block of plastic to rest the PSP on). With that said, it worked great as a display stand for either storing the PSP when not in use, while charging, or for watching movies.', u\"The Vita cradle improves on this idea by adding actual electronics to it (the center of the stand has a USB attachment that the vita rest on). The rear of the cradle has a Vita USB input and Line Out audio jack.  You  will need your own PS Vita USB Cable to use this stand for charging or syncing. While it has the ports on it, the cables are not included. It's also worth noting that the USB input on the back requires a USB cable (it would have been nice if they used a more standard cable design - something like a Mini USB cable - so that you can use your vita cable as a spare or to take with you for times you might need to use it (charging the vita on the go, etc..)\", u'I was very impressed with just how light the stand is - despite having some electronics in it, it feels incredibly light (about the weight of an empty Vita game case).'][u' One problem with the PSP stands were that they were quite heavy -- not a problem for sitting on your desk, but you can\\'t really take it \"on the go\" with you.', u'With the smaller profile of the cradle, it can also easily fit into your bag (I was able to fit it into the official PS Vita Travel Pouch without issues, placing it in the \"accessories\" side where the game cards, AC adapter and USB cables would normally go). There is still room to hold a PS vita.', u'Quality is OK - I think it can take a couple drops, but with the light material used I can also see it getting scratched/showing wear, or even snapping pieces off if dropped onto a hard (concrete) floor from more than a few feet.', u\"The front design looks very nice (it's a brushed metal look with a Playstation logo in the center) - much nicer than the (more functional) PS Vita stands out there that feature speakers. The front panel is also covered with a clear plastic.\", u\"The back Line Out output has a 3.5mm connector (standard headphone-sized)  and can be used to either plug headphones into it (unlikely situation) or connect it to an external set of speakers (more likely situation). This makes it great for movie viewing (it's also angled just for that purpose!). Whether you choose to connect it to a set of external speakers or not, you have a much nicer hands-free view of the screen (which will help with movie watching or listening to music while still being able to easily see/access the screen).\", u\"While the material it's made of is very light, I'm OK with that simply because it makes the unit more portable (if you're watching movies on it, there isn't too much reason to watch it at your desk at home when you have easy access to other video sources (computer/blu-ray players/dvd players/large TV's/PS3's) - if you're watching movies on it, you're probably away from the home. If that's the case, you don't want to carry a stand as big, heavy and bulky as the vita itself.. so this design really works nicely.\", u'What I would have really liked, to make this product even better..', u'* 2 Inputs (either 2 vita USB inputs or 1 Vita input + 1 AC input) so you can charge and sync without constantly swapping the USB cable)', u'* TV out (in addition to the Audio out) so you can watch movies on a larger screen, or a front headphone output', u\"* Ability for it to fold into itself - the design is good but it seems like it should be able to compact down to about half of it's size (this might come at the expense of making it more fragile though).\", u'Overall, very happy with it - well worth the money, but not for everyone.', u'If you never plan to sit it down on a desk (ie: you always store it in a bag), never want to \"display it\" and never plan to watch movies on it.. you don\\'t need this. I fyou plan to do any of the above, this is a great item to have,']", ["\n  Probably like the previous reviewer some people might think that the cradle comes with its own AC adapter power cable, it doesn't nor has it implied that it ever did.  You must read the information of a product carefully and also check online about the product you can't just assume it's going to have something and get annoyed when it doesn't.  The cradle is about the width size of a paperback book but the design feels sturdy enough though as expected the cradle is made of plastic it won't break easily unless you step on it or intentionally break it.  The back of the cradle has the adapter port to plug attach the ac power adapter to as well as an audio output port for mini-speakers as well.  So again while you do get the PS Vita cradle with an instruction booklet you will not get a power cable or anything else but no fears on the cable as you will get that with the PS Vita itself.\n"], ["\n  Nothing out of the ordinary for this accessory. Sturdy build and lovely finish. This is ideal for watching any videos on the Vita or using the Wake-Up Alarm app. It's a beautiful, secure way to charge your Vita while displaying it and/or using it. It has an input for external speakers (which I haven't made use of yet but is a nice feature to have).", "*As it says in the description it does NOT come with an extra charger.*", "It's a simple, worthwhile, and recommended accessory for any gamer with a Vita.\n"]], "rating_change": "", "video": "", "current_price": "$9.64", "count_customer_reviews": "252 customer reviews", "previous_price": "$19.99", "image": ["http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/214ZkY9-C7L._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31XChU78oCL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31EELG18zQL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31RJoqOSLPL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418SzjpYjXL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg"], "category_path": "Electronics / Video Game Consoles & Accessories / PlayStation Vita / Accessories / Accessory Kits"}

It's simple one button operation makes it very easy to use.  I also really like how the power button lights up differently, with the same color code as the Vita itself, to let you know the status of the battery.  I received mine, plugged it in to charge, and in about 2 hours it was good to go.  The power button even blinks the different colors to let you know what the charging progress is.  It is very compact, recharges itself quickly, charges the Vita properly, and is at a very good price point...unlike the memory cards.  If Sony missed the mark with those, they definitely made up for it with this.\", u'As far as the battery itself, there are cheaper alternatives, but they will not work properly with the Vita.  Here is why.  Practically every other battery of this size, capacity, and even in the ballpark of this price point, only has an output of 1.0 amps.  This battery has an output of 1.5 amps.  The PS Vita\\'s internal circuitry looks for this output, and if it doesn\\'t see it, it won\\'t charge while powered up.  If you want to play while charging, or without shutting down completely, this is the only battery like this that will work.  You can\\'t go by the \"5v, 5000mAh\" rating, as others have suggested.  If playing while charging is important to you, this is the battery you need.', u'Something to be mindful of, is that this battery is all you get in the package.  You will need the USB cable that came with the Vita, as well as the Vita power brick, to charge it.  You can also use the Sony Vita car charger to charge your battery on the go, or you can charge it via most any USB cell phone charger, or USB 2.0/3.0 port.  Remember, that like the Vita itself, this battery likes a 1.5 amp output for charging.'][u'  The charger that came with an iPhone is only 1.0 amps, but the one that came with the iPad is 2.1 amps.  That means that this battery will charge the iPhone, and even the new iPad (which requires a minimum of 1.5 amps) with no problem whatsoever, depending on your screen brightness (since that determines how much power the iPad needs to draw).  It is so versatile, I have ordered two more of them to have on hand.', u'Another nice thing about this battery, is that it fits very well in the limited edition clam shell case that came as part of the First Edition bundle.  In that little cargo pocket up top I have the portable battery, the USB cable, the Vita headphones, and a few games wrapped up in a screen cleaning cloth.  With two games in each of the elastic game pockets, I have all I need for a day out and about, and nothing is \"crammed\" in anywhere.  That was not the case when I had to carry the AC brick/cord up there.  This battery definitely cleans up the package nicely.', u'As a side note, if you need or want additional USB cables, the Vita AC power brick, or the Vita car charger, I have seen them on clearance at most Target stores for between five and ten dollars each.  They even have the Sony PS Vita travel case for five bucks.']", "[u'UPDATE:  Full charge clocked in at a little under 10 hours of gameplay for the PSP title listed in the original review.', u\"ANOTHER UPDATE:  I am going to bump up my review to 5 stars.  I'm sitting in LaGuardia with a MiFi hotspot whose battery was low.  The Energizer portable laptop charger that I carry around to charge my phone, laptop, etc, wouldn't charge it while I was using the hotspot.  This Vita charger does, and is a fraction of the physical size.\", u'-----------------ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW------------------------', u'The short of it:  AT LEAST 6 1/2 hours of non-wifi gameplay so far, and still going.', u'I intend to update this review once I get through a full cycle of the charger and perhaps also test it on some other devices, but for now I wanted to put something up so people on the fence can get some idea of the device.', u'I\\'m testing how much extra play this will give the Vita as we speak.  I ran down the existing battery charge until I got my first \"Low Battery\" message from the Vita.  After that, I plugged in the charger (after giving it time to fully juice up) and started playing a game through which I could track game time.', u'In my case, I chose the PSP game \"The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky\".  Note that this games doesn\\'t use any wifi and is probably pretty easy on the battery, but I wanted to guage the charge under some kind of consistent conditions.', u\"OK, all that said, here is the point.  I've recorded six and a half hours of game time and the battery still has juice left.  And that is game time as measured by the game itself, e.g. I started using the charger as I was 22 hours 50 minutes into the game, and now the game clock says 29 hours 20 minutes.\"][u\"  That's not even counting times when I reloaded, start-up time, etc.\", u\"So, this battery pack definitely delivers its advertised 4-7 hours of extra gameplay.  I'm knocking it down one star (for now) because it is a little difficult to read which side is the input and which is the output.\", u\"In short, if you are on the fence, I'd say go for it.  This will be great for travelers who don't have an outlet all the time.\"]", "[u\"Update July 2013: Almost a year later this thing still works excellently! I have left it charged months at a time (it's probably a horrible thing to do) yet every time I was curious and pressed the power button to check the charge, it's always been green (even after 4 months!). Excellent product, highly recommended!\", u\"Update: The owner's manual states it will take approximately 7 hours to fully charge the device; unfortunately, I was not present to record the time when the indicator light turned off. For size comparisons, please refer to pictures I have uploaded. Also, I would like to add that this fits snugly inside the Official Sony Travel Pouch and since the width (or depth I should say) of the device is similar to the power brick, you may use the power brick to see if this charger will fit in your travel cases however the other dimensions are different so account for those. I will update again after continued use!\", u'--Original Review--', u\"Author's Note: I will update this when I have used the device. These are initial impressions with information provided in the owner's manual that are not presented in the product information.\", u'The object is pretty weighty (135g) about as heavy as an iPhone 4 and the dimensions are 67 x 79 x 22mm (2.7 x 2.8 x 0.9 in).', u'Input: DC 5V/1.0A', u'Output: DC 5V/1.5A', u'Battery: DC 3.'][u'7 V, 5000mAh', u'When Charging the portable charger the button indicator blinks:', u'Green - Approximately 70% or more battery charge in the charger', u'Orange - Approximately 40 - 70% battery charge in the charger', u'Red - Approximately 40% or less battery charge in the charger', u'Not lit - Fully Charged', u'When Charger is supplying power to devices button lit continuously,', u'Green - Approximately 70% or more battery charge in the charger', u'Orange - Approximately 40 - 70% battery charge in the charger', u'Red - Approximately 40% or less battery charge in the charger', u'Not lit - Fully Charged/No remaining charge in charger', u\"Remember that this device outputs at 1.5A for your Vita (this is the minimum output required for the Vita to stay on and charge simultaneously) however, if you plug in another device; let's say an smartphone, the charger will adjust to the required current (around 1A) . In other words, it won't fry your smart phone's battery.\", u\"IMPORTANT: Please note that this requires (!!) the Vita charger to charge the portable charger. The bottom of the portable charger has the input charging port which is the same port that the PS Vita requires to charge (USB port on the top and PS Vita charging port is on the bottom). In a way that's convenient because it cuts down on packaging and pricing if you own a Vita; however if you don't own a Vita you will need to buy BOTH the USB cord AND the AC adaptor. So if you are considering purchasing this without owning a Vita, look for an alternative as the USB cord and AC adaptor are pricey!\", u\"The reason I bought this over other alternatives is the 1.5A that will allow me to play both my Vita and charge it simultaneously. As for the need for the AC adaptor, I think it's a great idea to reduce the amount of cords cluttered around. If I were to really travel somewhere far I would bring my Vita charger anyway so I don't see why people find this to be a fault.\", u\"I will run a few tests to see whether this device can charge an iPhone 4S, HTC Evo 3D, and other USB charged devices <the battery charges the listed devices> I find around the house. I will also test to see if the charger can charge itself while simultaneously charging the Vita <does not work, you can only charge one or the other>.

Subjectively speaking, it's a marked improvement over the factory analog stick heads.", "It should be tough not to find one design that is not a personal preference over the stock convex analog stick head. The only problem is that the set only contains one of each design type meaning, if you don't want to mix and match two different types of cap designs, you should buy two sets. I would have preferred matching sets for the analog stick caps, but it is exactly what is shown in the product description photos. No complaints or misrepresentation there.", "The caps add a slight amount of height to the analog sticks for better leverage, and the silicone material provides excellent grip.\n"], ["\n  The reviews are right, these are just hard plastic pieces, but for the price they are great (although it would be nice if they were latex coated, but not a deal breaker.)  I wanted something to make the sticks feel better, and they do.  I used the recessed caps, which just snapped on easily, and are easy to remove if you need to.  I also used the D-pad piece as well, which works great, although you need to apply a sticker to the d-pad to get the cover on.  Once putting the caps on, I couldn't go back to playing without them, which is especially noticeable playing games like Killzone Mercenary or any other shooter.

However, if you hang in there and take the time to read the instructions, you will come to realize the benefits of the design.", "  A key feature in the design is the two part, split removal of the protector when it is applied. The design allows you to keep the protector extremely close to the screen, thus minimizing the chance for either air bubbles or stray dust particles to creep under. I ended up with not one single air bubble nor stray dust particle, and thus it is near impossible to tell that there even is a screen protector on the device.", "  My only criticism is that I would have preferred a small, rectangular piece of plastic to the fold over cardboard that was included.

It fits very nice, tight, and firmly with the PSVita. There aren't any super easily stretchable feel to it once worn (especially around the button and direction areas); the holes of the silicone protection go to the right areas of the PSVita, and don't nudge to different areas and such; you get the point. :) The plastic is simply secured onto the right places awesomely, so the plastic isn't going to simply stretch out like mad during your use of your the buttons and the like. This product is of high-quality plastic made by Hori. Hori well-known for their arcade style controller sticks, and their top-notch quality accessories; I give them my thanks for the awesome fighting sticks... Don't know what I'll do without them.\", u\"Anyway, so this product is what I expected, but there is just one tiny little problem that might be a big turn-off to some, or will not be that big of deal at all... Okay here goes; The PS button's light indicator on the bottom left corner is completely blocked off by the silicone protection.. Yes, blocked..! :( In my opinion, it's not really a big deal, because meh, you're probably going to charge during late night without looking at the indicator, wake up next day, then it's probably fully charged after the hours of your sleep (the PSVita charges pretty quick, by the way), so during the night charge, it'll be fully charged in the morning, so on and so forth, therefore it's not really necessary to check... but it's a cool feature; I know.\"][u\" Another way to check is to just turn on your PSVita, and check the battery indicator on the top right, but it won't tell you if it is fully charged, but through the night, it most definitely will be in the morning.. So for those of you that want to know physically just by looking if your PSVita is charging, full, powered up, or not, having the PSVita button covered up may leave you guys griping about this product not having a PS button see-through button protection. The easiest thing to do when you want to know if your PSVita is charging, or if it's fully charged, and etc, all you really have to do is pull/lift up the plastic next to the PS button area, and you'll see what is going on.. Otherwise, this is a pretty neat PSVita protector that will pretty much do everything in it's plastic power to bounce off short falls, and prevent scratches on the sides and back quite efficiently.\", u\"Have a good one with your Hori PSVita silicone protector.

Still using it on my PSVita and it is nice and firm after a couple years and months. I use the PSVita quite frequently too; it's not like I leave it be.

When I got this case I was bit scared because the packaging that the actual case comes in looks a little shabby, Like something you might be a cheap toy out of. But the case itself however... top quality. It splits into two peices, front and back. The front piece is made of an aluminum-like facing and a well-molded thich plastic. The good thing is that none of it feels cheap. The plastic feels thick and it feels protective. It's very flush with the design of the PS Vita so you don't feel like you're being forced into a new ergonomic design. The back peice is made of the same plastic however where your pinky, ring, and middle fingers normally rest inthe grooves of the design, are replaced with more soft-aluminum plating and it fits perfectly. When you hold this case withthe PS Vita in it, it feels like you're simply playing with a minimumly thicker yet very re-enforced PS Vita. I love it!\", u'As far as obstruction goes, the only thing blocked is the two screws near the power port which is not important because i believer those are only there for helping with any future repairs or dissassembly of the unit, so it doesnt affect functionality whatsoever. The sim port is also blocked but if you\\'re a technicaly savvy person, you know that you dont need to remove the SIM card ever unless you\\'re replacing it so again, this doesnt matter since AT&T Sim cards are like fill up cards,. \"If you run out of Data, you simply log in on their site and buy some more data\". So, other than that there arent any other obstructions on the device making it one of the best cases on the market in my opinion.'][u' Every other case is way too bulky or is designed so that you cant actually play yhe device without it being completely out of the case of without a huge flap panel hanging off of the device.', u\"Now for gameplay comfortability. The front aluminum face plating doesn't obstruct with any of the buttons if you have normal hands. However, I'm a thick handed invidual. I like to think I play with bear paws. However, this still doesnt affect my gamepleplay. The joy sticks are fully movable without any interference and the buttons all feel comfortably reachabke. I was a bit hesitant at first because I thought that some of the buttons might feel uncomfortable to press since they would be descended into the plating. That isn't the case. The buttons feel just as they did before. The only buttons that I feel are a little hard to reach, probably because of my thick fingers are the Start Button and the select button. Also the power button on top may be a bit hard to reach for thick-fingered individuals. The volume button feels great to reach. No problem there. The cameras are completely unobstructed so they see perfectly. The back touch pad is perfectly available and is not obstructed. Same goes for the front screen. This case is about as flush as it gets AND still maintains to protect the case.\", u\"The only protection you would need after this is probably an Invisible Shield or a Potective fillm for the screen, if you're overly cautious like I am.\", u\"EDIT: I've added some photos for anyone wondering how it looks ON the device. Enjoy!\"]", ["\n  Just received my case and it fits perfect with the Vita...With this case on, you have access to all the ports. PS button can also be seen unlike other cases that I seen. Front of the case has an aluminum faceplate and back of case is made out of plastic not bulky at all...quality seems very good and looks like it can survive multiple drops, though I don't plan on dropping my Vita :) This case also feels very comfortable when playing games, dual shocks & buttons are not obstructed at all with this case on. One last note, the PS Vita with this case on will also fit inside of the PS Vita Limited Edition Case that came with the First Edition Bundle so that's a huge plus for me...\n"], ["\n  This is a great case for the Vita. Snaps on tight and won't accidentally come off, no ports are blocked at all.  Fits snugly in the first edition bundle case.

I bought these for that sole reason because the last couple of years I've had to stop playing some of the games I wanted because I couldn't bare it, my headache and eyestrain would go through the roof and even web surfing and reading on the computer was a forced chore that I had to endure for school. but with these, when I start getting eyestrain I put these on and it goes away.\", u\"don't let the yellow tint throw you off, once you get used to them you honestly do not notice it while gaming. you just completely forget that their is a tint, until you take them off. then everything looks shockingly blue when you do.\", u\"so again, they are comfortable, fit my head, I like them, they look cool, and they really do work. don't use these if your not sitting close to the screen though far off objects get slightly blurry.

Performance will vary depending on your network but my trick seems to have been to ethernet my console into my router (using Verizon Fios).

I wanted the white slim bad enough, I thought I would give it a shot. Fear not, I've used and tested every feature, and it all works seamlessly. It truly is region free. Updates worked perfectly, remote play is amazing, and all my digital games and purchases were recognized on the PSN store and were able to be downloaded. Setting up was a breeze too. Simply select your language right from the start, and the rest is easy and intuitive. The only knock, if you want to call it one, is Japan uses the (O) button as \"Enter\" and the (X) button as \"Back, which it swapped in the US. Once the games load though, it's back to normal. It will take you a second to get use to, but it's hardly a gripe. If you're looking for one of the colored slim models, feel relieved that the Japanese edition works perfect.

Only problem now is I cannot find a slim enough case/pouch for it. If you have a PS3 or 4 you need one of these. Playing my PS4 while not in front of the tv is great.(If your kids control the tv you know what I mean!)

Here's the problems and their fixes:\", u'1. When you first power up, the getting started screens will take you through the normal language, location, time etc. stuff. DO NOT sign up for ATT 3G in this initial setup! Decline and click \"sign up later.\" If you don\\'t, you\\'ll go to the overwhelmed ATT website, and suddenly your input will start delaying, then, the screen will freeze with black or blue death.', u\"Fix: The blue-glowing playstation button is a combined escape and control-alt-delete. If it doesn't clear the freeze, hold the power button for 5 seconds, wait a second or two, then hold it again for 5 seconds and you'll get the setup screen again. This time DON'T sign up for ATT OR the PS3 network. Finish the setup, DO NOT opt into the PS3 network at this stage (Sony has now changed the name of this network to SEN for smart TV's, but Vita still calls it both) until setup is complete. Once you complete setup, you can go back and opt into ATT (at 14 bucks a month for 250 m) AND sign up for SEN/ PS3 online.\", u'2. Once you get ATT, beware of unplugging wifi.', u\"Fix: Even if you acquired and activated wifi at setup, once you activate ATT, Vita will default to 3G even if you're hot on wifi, kicking your setup wifi off. You have to go back into settings and reacquire wifi. DO THIS right away or you'll be charged by ATT even for setting up PS3 SEN!\", u'3. Missing handshake numbers (IMEI and ICCID).', u\"Fix: If you blow the first attempt to activate on ATT's overwhelmed website, try it a 3am on a weekday, not 11 am on a Saturday!\"][u\" Also, if you blow the first attempt, on the second, the auto fill for your device sometimes won't work, and ATT won't recognize the device because the two long ID's will be missing. In the background, ATT actually checks your location and assigns you a ghost phone number. That's right, your Vita will get it's own number, but until Verizon gets into the act, I doubt that we'll be able to do any phone activities other than on Skype! ATT WILL email the heck out of you, including giving you the ghost number you can't use.\", u\"Did you save the box? Numbers not there! Don't despair! Go to settings, system, then system information. The last two numbers (IMEI and ICCID) are stored in your device. These are the two numbers you need to activate the service on ATTs website.\", u'4. PS3 Net.', u\"Just like Facebook, SEN won't accept email addresses that aren't common extensions. So, if your email is Contact@JaneDoe.com, they will first accept it, then kick you off at the end of the tedious number by number input on the little Vita screen. Too bad ATT/Sony didn't include a direct web signup for your PC, but because of device recognition, you have to do it initially through the Vita, unless you already have a PS3 account from another Sony device.\", u'Fix: Just get JaneDoe@gmail.com (or Yahoo, your cable, etc.).

The review on the actual PSV hardware itself will follow.', u\"As many have already mentioned, the promo items (PSN game and data packet) are only redeemable AFTER paying for the initial data packet, so anyone who thinks they're getting their first month free and will be downloading Super Stardust shortly after charging up their PSV for the first time will probably be upset, and not unreasonably so as the conditions for redeeming the promo items are not mentioned on the box itself.  It's also a little underhanded to make users wait a month after using their first month of 3G service before they receive their game download code, but free is free I suppose and it is only a $10 DD game to begin with.\", u\"On the flip side, if anyone is actually buying a 3G model with the intention of NEVER paying for even one month/data packet, one almost has to question the intelligence of buying this model when the WiFi model is $50 less. At any rate, $15 isn't much for a two month (limited given the 250MB data cap) trial run of the service.\", u\"As for the 3G service itself, after one week of using it, about the only function it currently serves is for Near updates (PSV social app that shows who's playing what on the PSV in your proximity) and web browsing on the PSV's browser when outside of a WiFi network. It is very limited as of this writing and subjectively not worth subscribing to with the assumption that the PSV owner already has a smartphone with a data plan.\"][u' If the PSV is your only way of accessing a 3G network when cut off from WiFi, it still beats running around for a WiFi hotspot.', u\"Lastly, the bundle comes with a 8GB memory card that currently retails for $30. It is easily the best added value component of the bundle and even if one were to ignore the data packet/PSN game, it's only $20 over the cost of a $250 WiFi PSV when purchased with a $30 memory card. Seeing as how very little information has been put out regarding future uses for 3G and the PSV, $20 is nothing to add that feature on the chance that the service becomes worth renewing down the road. There are no service contracts.\", u\"As for the PSV itself, after two weeks of initial impressions, it is easily the most enjoyable handheld gaming device I have used running all the back to the original Gameboy and before with Nintendo Game and Watch games and Mattel Electronic Sports games, etc. The last two handhelds I've used extensively have been the PSP and the 3DS for recent comparisons.\", u'The 5\" OLED display is the first noticeable feature, with its ink like blacks, high contrast, relatively tight pixel density and even light distribution due to the self illuminating OLED pixels.', u'Build, fit and finish feels balanced and substantial. Face buttons and D-pad have a very satisfying click feedback that feels precise and responsive. The D-pad in particular, as the first deviation from the familiar Playstation 4 arrow button cross design is the best feeling D-pad I can remember using. The face buttons are smaller than those of the PSP and slightly larger than those of the 3DS. The X button proximity to the right analog stick has been mentioned as a potential issue, presumably for those who press with the heel of the thumb (\"rolling\") rather than the tip of the thumb (precise).', u'Following the OLED display, the second most prominent feature is the twin analog sticks, a first for handhelds. Unlike the sliding disk design used by the PSP and again by the 3DS, the PSV uses actual mini analog sticks with the same single axis rocking action everyone who has used an analog stick controller is familiar with. The feedback is a bit tighter than that of the DS3 with less travel due to the short throw axis which basically means more precise input is both possible and required for games without aim assist or loose controls. The size will probably take some getting used to for most, but for anyone who managed to adapt to the barely usable slider disk of the PSP, the analog sticks should be a snap to use.', u'The size of the PSV is another oft noted design issue, which is partially to accomodate the 5\" screen in addition to the real estate taken by the face buttons, analog sticks and D-pad. Yes, the bezel could be thinner, but the controls themselves really can\\'t be spaced much closer without causing more issues than solving. \"Not pocket-sized\" is another oft made comment regarding the size although it will easily slip into the back jeans pocket of just about any pair of jeans with at least a 30\" inseam that aren\\'t cut or worn like jeggings. I just don\\'t know who would actually want to carry something like the PSV in their back pocket without some sort of case, slip cover, etc. to prevent scratches or other damage.', u'On the plus side, the PSV should fit average to large size hands very comfortably compared to the DS/DSl/3DS, PSP/PSP Go, etc. It\\'s the first handheld I\\'ve used that didn\\'t give me \"crab claw hand\" after 30 minutes of use. The position of the analog sticks are a comfortable distance away from the trigger buttons on the top of the PSV and the rounded shape with shallow contours moulded into the rear make it the most comfortable handheld I\\'ve used to date.', u'Sound volume from the built in speakers is adequate for a device of its size. Louder than the PSP or 3DS at max volume. Sound quality should fall in line with expectations for a portable device of its size. Naturally, the best sound output will be from a pair of quality headphones or a line out jack to a stereo system.', u'Battery life is adequate compared to the 3DS and PSP and realistically provides about 3-4 hours of gaming (PSV games) with more for PSP games, video, music, etc. Without the swappable battery design used in the PSP, there is no option to buy extra batteries for long trips away from a charger socket. SCE will be selling a $50 portable charger pack in the near future which while far from ideal, is better than no solution at all.', u'Users of iOS devices will feel right at home with the front and rear touch panels. Multi-touch, capacitive type interface that is more sensitive than the iPad to the degree that it is possible to trigger touch input without actually touching the display (if a bioelectric source, ie. finger, is about 1mm away).', u'That about covers the hardware itself without delving into the PSV games or any of the software functionality built into the PSV OS, which can and will be updated via firmware updates as more features are added and refined.', u\"Overall, couldn't be more impressed with the hardware, barring a few annoyances like the lack of any onboard memory (the 3DS has 2GB internal memory, in addition to a 2GB SD card shipped with every handheld), the overpriced proprietary memory cards (deja vu Memory Stick) which serve the twofold purpose of slowing the tide of software piracy as well as provide hardware revenue to recoup potential losses Sony is taking on every PSV sold and the essentially useless VGA resolution cameras that are only useful for in-game use including the free augmented reality games available in the PSN Store for download.\", u'The hardware is solid, the only issue from here on out will be the steady release of diverse, quality titles that will either make or break the platform.']"], "rating_change": "", "video": ["http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/B1JHqIy9gOS.mp4"], "current_price": "$249.00", "count_customer_reviews": "420 customer reviews", "previous_price": "$299.99", "image": ["http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HvXyT2FCL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41%2BEyPlgkcL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418ElUnMU8L._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21pLJlZnZAL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81IGpHPUIQS._SX35_SY46._CR0,0,35,46_PImini-player-shuttle-50px,BottomLeft,-7,12_.png"], "category_path": "Electronics / Video Game Consoles & Accessories / PlayStation Vita / Consoles"}

I did not want to spend between $200-$500 for a top-of-line cutting edge console with all the bells and whistles for a 6-year-old who doesn\\'t need those features and doesn\\'t have a clue what 1080p means. By the time my 6-year-old does get into more advanced gaming and wants multi-player features and internet download capabilities, no-doubt there will be a new, fancier video game console than the Wii U or the XBOX One. He certainly doesn\\'t need \"backwards capability\" since he\\'s new to video games or wi-fi for Netflix and internet downloads.', u\"I purchased my Wii Mini on December 13th from TRU for $99 including the Mario Kart.  I was concerned about whether I would be able to hook this up to my Samsung LCD HDTV since some of the reviews claim it CAN'T be hooked up to an HDTV.  To avoid a Christmas morning fiasco, I went ahead and opened the box, and this literally took me about 30 seconds to hook up to my television.  It couldn't have been easier.  Seriously, a monkey could do it.  You put the yellow cord in the yellow hole, white cord in the white hole, red in the red.  It's really that simple.  I have no idea how every brand of LCD flat panel is designed, but on my Samsung the plug holes were located right on the side of the television.  Very easy to access.  See the photo I've included for a picture of the television hook-up. Other than that, it was just plugging it into the outlet and installing the included AA batteries in the remote.  I actually played a little Mario Kart just to see what it was like and had a blast.\"][u'  Were the graphics amazing, cutting-edge-blow-your-mind-high-definition?

Buy it cause its a great way to get you tiny Vita games on the big screen.  Hopefully the latter will be updated sooner then later but until then be warned.\", u'Original Review:', u\"The Vita TV also known as the PlayStation TV in the west. Is it worth it? A lot depends on what your expecting to get from it, and if you already have a Vita. Let's break it down.\", u'Design:', u\"It's a small little black box, about the same size and weight as a deck of playing cards. Has only the basics and that's it. HDMI output, Ethernet input, Vita Memory Card slot, Vita game card Slot and a USB port to charge controllers.\", u\"I have it placed on my TV stand and I barely notice it, and I think that's great.\"][u' Over the weekend I wanted to show my friend Deception IV: Blood Ties and I could easily pop it into my pocket and take it over to his house to connect to his 55\" TV.', u'Presentation:', u\"So let's first look at the numbers then talk about what that really means to the player. The box projects at 1080i, and 2.0 stereo sound. Personally I think the sound is the biggest loss, but completely understandable, these are Vita or older games being played on this, none of them were made for the home theater surround sound experience.\", u'Many people these days are obsessed that the magic number of 1080p... I wont go into my feeling on this, but say most game including the amazing looking Last of US on PS3 was at 720p. Most games on Xbox 360 and PS3 were and never went above 720p and it was fine. The Vita is a much less powerful device and it does what it needs to fine.', u\"What the Vita TV (PlayStation TV) does is takes the image that's on the Vita, and puts it on your TV. That's it. Nothing Fancy, so if you were ok with the quality of the image of the game on you Vita, then you'll be fine with it on the big screen. The quality that is in the Vita, and the TV version look comparable. I have noticed that older games look more upscaled, games like Persona 4: Golden, while new games like Killzone Mercenaries looks awesome.\", u'Games and Touch Functionality:', u'So it can play 700 games right now, this includes about 80% of Vita games, all PSP & PlayStation One games that are on the PSN store, and some PS Mobile games like Chaos Rings.', u\"The Vita games that aren't touch oriented exclusively like Persona 4, Killzone, Walking Dead, and so on work fine on the Vita TV, while games like Tearaway, that are all about the Vita specific controls can't be played.\", u\"Considering most games that come out on the Vita have alternative controls for the touch functions anyways, that means there are a ton of games to choose from, especially if you're an JRPG fan.\", u'As for Touch Funtionality... so you can use the Dual Shock 3 control, by clicking the L3 or R3 buttons, and it will put these Mickey Mouse looking hands on the screen to poke things. But all the quickness of the touch screen is gone. You can us the Dual Shock 4 Controller, but the touch pad is only a slight improvement from the DS3 option but comes up with the same terrible results.', u\"Honestly this is where the product shows it's rough edges. And must be thought of as what do you want this to play, is it non touchy Vita games, old PSP games or older, cause if so this wont be an issue at all. But a Game like SENRAN KAGURA SHINOVI VERSUS where most of the game has nothing to do with touch screen stuff for it's a brawler, lacks when it comes to touch and will block you from getting a trophy in the changing room cause of it.\", u'Controllers:', u\"You can use both the Dual Shock 3 and Dual Shock 4. I attached both and been switching back and forth as batteries die, and haven't really decided which is better, cause the touch aspect for both as terrible, it really comes down to which do you like better and if your going to be doing things like remote play with it.\", u\"I should note that all motion controls for both controllers is lost, and I'm not totally sure why, cuase the Vita itself had motion capabilities.\", u'Remote Play:', u\"As for Remote Play, I have mine connected by Wi-Fi, but I have my Vita TV and PS4 connected to the same TV so I'm not going to use this other then for Testing. The quality is definitely upscaled, but again looks just like it did on the Vita, kind of bad. I will blame my connection, but as with the Vita remote play experience it has a slight input delays and screen tearing, and picutre quality is definitely in the 720p or even 720i area.  And still can't Remote play things like the Blu-Ray movies, or Netflix.\", u'Video/Streaming Services and Apps:', u\"So first off at Launch it only has Crunchyroll to speak of or the videos you bought off the PSN. So if you're wanting this to be the PlayStation streaming device for your living room... keep looking. I bet it will get Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime and hopefully HBO Go at some point, but not yet. And again it is in 1080i, which most those services are stream in full HD, so if you have another option I'd recommend using that for your streaming needs instead.\", u\"But the cool thing is it still is a Vita, and if you find a Video on the net you want to watch, instead of being like the PS4 and just telling you it can't play them, it will simply download them.\", u'Oh, and it can play your music, which still lacks on the PS4.', u'UI:', u\"It's exactly the same as the Vita, so it's comfortable to use, but being done so by a controller takes a few minutes to get used to but nothing special. But, you can still change each background to whatever image you want, use folders, and themes.\", u'So is it Worth It:', u\"A lot depends on what your buying it for. I bought it cause I rarely play my Vita at home when I have my sexy flat screen to use instead. Also when going hardcore into a game on the Vita, pretty much means my battery will die just when I'm about to get somewhere good, and the Vita TV doesn't have this problem. And finally a lot of the games I play are JRPGs, the monster hunter style games, and visual novel puzzle games like Dangan Ronpa, which all work wonderfully on the Vita TV.\", u\"I also think it will be great to bring along on business trips or vacation. It's light, easy to travel, and can get hooked up to any HDMI TV easily. And most importantly doesn't run out of batteries.\", u\"If I was looking for a second PS4, or a Video streaming device then I wouldn't have gotten it at launch, and would have waited till the streaming Apps have updated.\", u\"Finally, owning a Vita and a Vita TV makes sense, if I only owned this I'd be missing out on some of the aspects of the Vita that really make it a stand out device. And games like Walking Dead would remain to be a frustration experience instead of what it is on the Vita an amazing blend of touch controls and actual controls.\", u\"I really wish it didn't use the damn Vita memory cards, instead had some real internal memory, and that the Dual Shock 4 touch pad worked better with it.  But a lot of the negative reviews are from people that wanted a Sony Apple TV or a Second PS4, and sadly those reviews are completely correct.  It lacks a lot in those areas, and really isn't worth it if thats your only interest in the device, but I bought it to play Vita games on my TV, and works are expects, if not better.\"]", ["\n  I`ll start of my review by saying that for $100 this is a steal. This little device can turn your tv into a smart tv, which is what I did. The bundle comes with the pstv the power cable & an hdmi cable as well, not to mention a remote & a voucher to download the lego movie game.

{"category": "Consoles", "available": "In Stock.", "average_customer_review": "4.4 out of 5 stars", "name": "PlayStation Vita - Wifi", "first_available": "", "url": "http://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Vita-Wifi/dp/B003O6EATE/ref=zg_bs_3010601011_4", "asin": "B003O6EATE", "brand": "Sony", "item_model_number": "", "reviews": ["[u\"**I wrote a pretty big review on the 3DS, and as I mentioned in that review, I definitely was going to write one for the vita. I usually support my reviews for a while, so I will be reading all comments and will keep updating the review over the next few weeks as I learn more and more. Please do comment with any info you have and I'll edit the review**\", u\"In short, the Playstation Vita is an amazing multimedia device packed with tons of cool features. We all know it's an amazing system and I won't be talking specifically about every single feature -- I'll leave that to Sony and the Amazon description. Instead, I'll look at in comparison to the 3DS and how it functions as a multimedia device overall (in comparison to mobile phones, iPods, etc). I also will give you a run down on what makes the Vita a great system and what limitations it has.\", u'~~~~~~~', u'Pros:', u'~~~~~~~', u\"1) Ridiculous hardware. Very powerful GPU and processor for a handheld system. This thing blows the 3DS graphics out of the water and don't even try comparing it to mobile app games graphic-wise. I wouldn't say the graphics are quite PS3 level from my time with Uncharted, but they're pretty close. The analog sticks protrude from the system a tad more than the original PSP's did and are a bit on the small side, but they still feel solid and having two analog sticks is a huge plus for most games.\", u'2) Beautiful Screen. The screen is very high resolution and is very large. The screen is a 5 inch OLED and is actually very bright. On max brightness, this shuts out lots of glare that usually plague mobile devices, so you could definitely use this in bright environments.', u'3) Strong Launch Line-up. There are a few solid launch titles and many more in the near future.'][u'4) Cross Game chat and Trophy support for games. The Vita finally brings cross game voice chat (something which PS3 users have been wanting for ages).', u'5) Huge multimedia potential. You can transfer over music or videos (you may have to convert them into the few formats that the Vita recognizes though), stream things through Netflix or a media center PC, or get content off of the PSN (Playstation Network). Combined with the gorgeous screen, multimedia on the go will be awesome.', u'~~~~~', u'Cons:', u'~~~~~', u\"1) Memory cards. What you need to know: for major games, YOU HAVE TO BUY A MEMORY CARD to save your game data (Uncharted is one of these games). The memory cards are in a new Sony format that are a bit pricy ($20 for 4GB, $30 for 8GB, $60 for 16GB , $100 for 32GB). I wish Sony would have used SD cards like the 3DS or even micro-SD cards if they wanted something smaller. Maybe they did it to combat piracy (which was hugely rampant on the PSP), maybe to make a bit extra money instead of losing money to the SD card manufacturers. In any case, it's annoying to us consumers. It's also kind of ridiculous that after paying $250 that the system comes with no storage space. If the device had a built in 8GB of storage, it would be much more competitive. Remember, the memory card is where you'll be saving game data for big games, music, movies, and whatever you download from the Playstation Network. Without a memory card, you're missing out on the full multimedia potential of the Vita.\", u\"2) Mediocre / Poor Battery Life. As much as I hate to admit it, it seems like bad battery life is a trend in all of our electronics now. Sony officially claims about 3-5 hours for gameplay, which is just about as much as you'll get with the 3DS. From personal usage, I've been through two charge cycles already - I timed the second one ( and from 100% to 10% while playing Uncharted in just a tad over 3 hours.\", u\"3) Not so pocket-able. This device is actually kind of big for a portable gaming device. It doesn't fit in my jeans, but does nicely fit in my basketball and cargo shorts. For a mobile device, it's on the large end. It will definitely be bigger than your phone. It's kind of in an awkward zone - it's way smaller than a tablet, but noticeably bigger than phones. Also the protruding analog sticks don't help the portability case any.\", u\"4) Limited Backwards Compatibility. There is no UMD slot on the Vita, so you can't play physical PSP games. There's a big list of digital PSP games that you can play on the Vita, but not all of them. Sony claims to be expanding the list and hopefully we'll one day see all PSP titles on the Playstation Store. Also, currently the PS-One classics from the Playstation Store can't be played on the Vita. Sony also said they're going to work on this, but until then, there's no chance for me to catch up and finally beat some of those PS1 Final Fantasy titles while on the go. Also, the PS2 Games on the PSN aren't playable on the Vita and Sony hasn't said anything about that yet.  Other than that, the Vita can play all other PSN games and minis.\", u'==========', u'3DS ($170 / formerly $250) vs VITA ($250 / $300)', u'============', u\"1) Games: It's a bit unfair to compare at the moment because the 3DS has been out much longer than the Vita. At the moment, I'd have to say the 3DS has the better library with games like Ocarina of Time, Super Mario 3D Land, Mario Kart 7, StarFox, etc. Sony has some solid games already on launch though, which the 3DS lacked. If you look back, you'll quickly find out that people used to complain about the 3DS to no end because there was such a lack of games. The Vita has started strong and has a timeline of great games to come.\", u\"2) Hardware: Graphics-wise, there's really no comparison. The Vita completely blows away the 3DS. The screen on the Vita is a higher resolution and far greater quality. The touch screen on the vita uses different technology so the screen doesn't respond to stylus or pressure - it uses newer capacitive technology that only detects your finger. Both systems have pretty bad cameras, but the Vita's are noticeably better. Button wise, the Vita has the upperhand with two analog sticks, but I'll have to admit that personally I like the analog stick on the 3DS much more than the ones on the Vita. Two analog sticks will make most games, especially shooters, have better controls on the Vita.\", u\"3) Multimedia Potential: I'm going to have to give this one to the Vita. It has better speakers, a far better screen, and has a massive online network to get movies from. The 3DS does use SD cards which are better cost-wise for storing large amounts of music and videos, but the presentation on the Vita is just better.\", u\"4) Online:  Nintendo really dropped the ball on creating an online network and online multiplayer. Although I do like Xbox Live's online interface the best, the PSN is still miles and miles ahead of Nintendo with cross game chat and a network that is ridiculous better in almost every way.Even adding friends is a pain on the 3DS. The Vita on the other hand has a real network and is much more professional and easy to use.\", u'5) Other Features and Gimmicks: The 3DS obviously has 3D which is what makes it stand out compared to the Vita. The 3D is a huge selling point to a lot of people, and I will say it is pretty cool, especially in games that use it well such as Ocarina of Time and Super Mario 3D Land. Personally, after the \"oooh aahhh\" period in each game, I just turned off the 3D on my 3DS. 3D isn\\'t a big concern to me, but to a lot of people it probably makes the 3DS much more appealing. Both have accelerometers and gyroscopes for tilting and doing random things in games. Both have the augmented reality cards which lets games create battles and games right in front of your eyes in \"real life\".', u\"6) Portability:  Both have the same 3-5 hours of battery life for games and last around 8-10 hours for music. The poor battery life limits both systems forcing you to bring the charger on any long trip. The 3DS is much more pocket-able since the clamshell design lets you fold it and just stick it in your pocket. The Vita is bigger and will most likely jut out of jeans pockets. Actually, the more I think of it, the Vita's size is really awkward - it's too big for pocketing but way too small to be compared to a tablet.\", u\"7) Price. This is always a concern and indeed the Vita (WiFi) is $80 more than the 3DS. That's basically the price of two games. The Vita is bringing more to the table hardware-wise which explains the higher price. Sony systems usually do cost more than Nintendo, but it'll be to you when deciding which one to buy.\", u'~~~~~~~~~', u'3DS vs Vita Conclusion:', u'~~~~~~~~~', u'They\\'re both pretty different systems and in an ideal world, you should own both. But when we come back to reality and have money limitations, you\\'ll have to make your pick. The 3DS is already established and has a dozen solid titles on the market, the Vita is just coming out but still has many good games planned. The Vita definitely outclasses the 3DS in terms of hardware, multimedia support, and game If you\\'re a parent, you may sway toward Nintendo giving their reputation of making more family friendly and imaginative game, whereas Sony has a reputation of building solid hardware for a more \"core\" group of gamers. We\\'ll see what happens this time around.', u'================', u'Is the Vita worth $250 - in my opinion, yes! You get a system packed with the potential for great gameplay and multimedia.', u\"Is the Vita better than the 3DS? - well, that's a bit more complicated and I'll have to say that depends on what you want from your system.\", u\"Should I buy the 3G Vita for $300 or the WiFi for $250? I honestly was never going to pay a monthly subscription ($15 for 250mb of $30 for 3GB with AT&T) for 3G, so buying a 3G vita would have been a waste. That's why I went with the WiFi version to save money. The 3G version can do WiFi too - it just has the potential to be used in a 3G data plan. So, if you think 3G is a thing that you would pay for and find internet on the go useful, go ahead and buy the 3G. Otherwise, save your money and get the WiFi.\", u\"I'll add more to this review as I find out more. Feel free to comment if I missed anything, if you have something to add, or if you just want to rage at me. I'll definitely be updating this as I play around with the system more.\"]", "[u'A few hours since delivery... I\\'m impressed. Just about everything about the PSV: display, controls, features, the games - top of the line. This is a gaming machine that shouts \"quality\" and, after the first few hours of playing Uncharted and a couple of small games off the PSN, I can say that I\\'ve had the best portable gaming experience ever - we currently have a PSP and a DSi in the house plus a couple of tablets and smart phones.', u'Briefly - and I will update my review as I experience more of the PSV - these are my findings so far.', u'HARDWARE AND FEATURES', u\"I'm not going to get into details because Amazon's page has it all. Yes, it's quad-core this, and super-high-rez display that but what counts is that it translates into a super-smooth gaming experience with a bunch of non-gaming capabilities on top. I'm surprised how immersive playing a game on such a small screen with such tiny speakers can be. And it is so for a couple of reasons.\"][u\"- the sharpest, best looking display I've seen on a portable\", u'- the dual analog sticks make all the difference - Sony learned from past mistakes', u\"- the back touch panel are something that it's better to experience because it's the one clear innovation on this machine and it won't give you headaches (sorry Nintendo :) )\", u'- games can be either downloaded or purchased and shared on physical media - like I said, Sony is learning from past mistakes (sorry PSP Go)', u'- seamless integration with the PS3 and the Playstation Network', u\"- a bunch of great multimedia apps including Netflix - I'll have more to say about these after I stop playing Uncharted :)\", u'- cameras - more later but I heard that some games allow you to build characters that look just like you', u'THE GAMING EXPERIENCE', u\"Anyone who has a PS3 or a PSP should feel very familiar with the PSV. All the PS3 controls are there although some of the buttons are smaller. Add to that the 'touch' capabilities on both front and back with support for gestures and the gaming possibilities are almost endless. Because of its high resolution, there can be a lot happening at the same time on the PSV's screen and, don't forget, you can also feel the action while playing.\", u\"I don't feel like doing comparisons at this time but anyone who claims that the PSV is no big deal because we can play games on our phones should experience the PSV and then consider revising their statements. Vita can easily play any one-dollar game that a phone can play and I'm sure we'll get a couple of those and Vita can do just about everything a smart phone or tablet can do and most of the time do it better, but no phone or tablet can play Uncharted and no 'next generation' phone or tablet is likely to be able to play Uncharted or Little Big Planet. And, let's not forget that the Vita costs a less than most smart phones.\", u'EVERYTHING ELSE', u\"I haven't had time to explore all of Vita's features yet but, they're all in there. Multimedia, wireless connectivity, music playback... it's all in there. Add to that one of the best laid out, intuitive and responsive user interfaces and even non gamers should be happy to have a Vita around.\", u\"WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE\", u\"A couple of things. The most annoying is, of course, the hyper-overpriced memory card. You can't play 'big games' without one and Sony decided to make lots of money on this proprietary 'must have' add-on which is anything but optional. Then there's of course Sony not making the Passport program available in the US. We have a PSP and lots of games on UMDs. Not being able to play them on the Vita is very frustrating.\", u\"Other than that... perhaps I should have titled my review 'gamer changer' because the Vita is likely to change me into a more active portable player. I used to prefer the PS3 over the PSP but I'm not sure this will always be the case in the future. I know that I won't put the Vita down until I'm done with Uncharted and once I complete that there are at least half a dozen games available on lunch date that I'd like to play.\", u\"Oh and... I don't really like sharing our Vita with the kids at this time but I have to :)\", u'____________________________________________', u'NOTES OF CAUTION', u'Before deciding whether you want to buy a Vita and as you are budgeting for one, keep the following in mind:', u\"* SINGLE-USER SYSTEM - or so it is meant to be at this time. Like the PSP, the Vita will recognize only ONE account. Unlike the PS3, you can't have other members of your family or friends log with a sub-account. If you are planning to share the PSV, Sony suggests that individual users keep their game saves on separate memory cards but you will still be logged on the Vita as the one user who 'owns' it.\", u\"* TROPHIES - A Sony representative confirmed to me that only the 'owner' will get credit for the trophies, no matter who may be earning them during gameplay because the PSV only recognized one user.\", u\"* DOWNLOADS - If you buy a 'download' you will have to download that game on each of your family members memory cards who wish to play that game individually.\", u'* MEMORY CARDS SIZE - see above for the multiple users scenario. In addition, get the biggest memory card you can possibly afford. The size of downloaded games tends to be enormous. Uncharted alone is 3.2 GB which is just about all that a 4 GB card can hold. Most games I care about seem to be 2 GB or larger.', u\"* DON'T PLAN ON BUYING MANY DOWNLOADABLE GAMES - see above. Half a dozen downloaded games would fill up your 16 GB memory card with little room for anything else. I would buy games on physical media whenever possible.\", u'--', u\">> Brush your teeth, it's the law! <<\"]", "[u\"I have had this for 17 days, and so far I love it! I was worried whether it would be worth it, mainly because of the pricing, memory cards, and amount of games. I have a ps3 and buying games for two systems doesn't seem likely for a college student! Priced at only 20 bucks less than a ps3 game and depending on the title, it could set you back a lot. Even with all this, these are my reasons for why you should get it (and why not):\", u'Pros:', u'Feels nice in your hands, perfect size, not too heavy, but not light in a way where it feels cheap', u\"Amazing OLED screen, that is much bigger than the PSP's, Touch screen is great, and is being used nicely in some games\", u'Back touch screen is also pretty interesting, and I can see where games can make real use of it (they did in Uncharted)', u'Dual analog sticks', u'Sensors are perfect', u'Buttons feel nice', u'The quad core processor is wicked fast and smooth', u'Sound is pretty good', u'Games play great, amazing upcoming line up', u'Ok to talk a little about my experiences with the ps vita, I absolutely love it. It just feels nice, and the OLED touch screen feels right at home with my normal touch screen electronics. Kind of funny that it comes with a tutorial. Loving the analog sticks, work great and are very responsive. To touch on that quad core processor, its so fast! I can literally press the home button in the middle of an intense action filled game (uncharted) which is probably memory intensive, do something on the home screen, go right back, and the game feels like it never left. There was no lag, unlike when this is done on the ps3, though to be fair, you can surf the net while on a game on the ps3, and not on the ps vita.'][u' Just feels nice to be able to play games on the go which so much power, especially when I never have time to just play for hours. Not much else to say except I cannot wait to see what the game developers can do when they make more games for the ps vita.', u'Cons:', u'Battery life is a worry, 3 hours it had like 25% life left', u'Directional button is too close to the left analog stick', u'You cannot play ps one classics!', u'The psp games you can download, scale horribly on the ps vita, probably due to the difference in screen resolution.', u'As cool as the back touchpad is, it gets in the way of games that use it sometimes like uncharted.', u'Memory cards are expensive', u\"So let me start with the battery life. It is pretty bad, which saddens me. Such great hardware, it is a shame the battery couldn't be 6 hours of hardcore gameplay. Sony could have added a bigger battery, I assume of course. After about 2 hours you better have that charger handy to not get too low. For on the go casual gaming, its probably enough, but for the players that are on it for hours playing an intense (graphically) game, its not enough. The charger isn't compact, so its just annoying. I plan on getting around that by buying an external charger to charge on the go. Its very inconvenient and costly to have to dish out more money to have a great gaming experience for longer that 4 hours, especially if you aren't near a charger for a 6 hour or longer trip. But again, if you are a casual gamer, its perfect, playing for 30 minutes to an hour at a time, a few times a day, not bad. I will assume when connected to wifi for online gameplay, my experience with the battery will be much worse. One thing that I am very disappointed in is the lack of prone classic playable games! With such small, almost nonexistent library of rpg/fps games, being able to bring classics to such an amazing machine is a must. Yet this is missing, and knowing this, I can honestly say, don't rush buying this until there is better support, since you'll find the number of games are lacking (though there are a decent amount as compared to the 3DS). The last thing I want to point out is the memory card. I won't reiterate what everyone else is saying. They are ridiculously expensive. I get that it is suppose to keep the hacking to a minimum... but for god sakes, 50 dollars for a 16GB memory card?? Sony is literally sucking it for all its worth. Its a shame seeing as its an amazing products.

Plus, lugging around the MOGA Pro controller is not all that fun.\", u\"Also, I've never played Borderlands on any console, neither 1 nor 2, so I've got a fresh perspective, which can be good or bad depending on your take.\", u'Anyways, on to the review!', u\"Vita-2000 (Vita Slim) -- for a first time Vita player, this thing is fantastic! Extremely light (I can barely tell the difference between picking up my Vita and my Nexus 5), battery life is EXTREMELY under-stated by Sony (battery has lasted me well over 7 hours and I still haven't seen a low battery warning yet), and the screen looks great! While I'm a fan of bright and snappy colors, I've never been huge on OLED screens because of the black spots that tend to pop up, so I was actually happy when I saw the Slim was coming with an LCD screen. For those who've never seen the OLED screen, you aren't missing anything as in my opinion, the screen looks phenomenal. The touchscreen is responsive, and even though I've never played a Vita before, I've had only one or two rear-touchpad accidental swipes. Those enlarged finger rests on the back are an excellent addition. Oh and Micro-USB is a GREAT addition.\"][u' I can charge the Vita with any of the micro-USB cables I have lying around, and admittedly, the charger the Vita came with (with the power-brick, why is there a power-brick?!) is still in the box.', u\"One big gripe that I hope will be alleviated soon is that all peripherals are targeted towards the original Vita (which is to be expected, of course). I was dying to get the Amazon Sony-approved Case, but I've read the Vita slim is a very tight fit in that case, and I'd rather wait for a revision than risk damaging it (what irony that would be, right?). Since Sony won't be developing the OG Vita anymore, I'd imagine 3rd party peripherals will follow suit and start developing cases, grips, and screen protectors for the Vita Slim. Here's hoping that's sooner rather than later!\", u\"Borderlands 2 (PS Vita) -- this game is FUN! The controls take some getting used to and you definitely have to jack the joystick sensitivity up in the options screen (8 was enough for me), but this game is great! While I normally hate cel-shaded graphics (case in point - X-Men Legends.... ARGH), they look phenomenal on the Vita screen and this game really pops. I haven't gotten far enough to notice any framerate issues, but I've seen in other reviews that they aren't show-stoppers, so I'm not concerned. I really enjoy the game's humor, and while it can be a bit tough to aim and fire with the small joysticks at first, you get used to it fast and start to have fun. I haven't tried out 2-player Co-Op but plan to as soon as I get comfortable with the game and won't embarrass myself too bad when playing with someone else :)\", u'FYI - the download can take a while, everything including the DLC is almost 6 GB, which will eat up almost all available memory. As a result, I could only download smaller Vita indie games I picked up from PS+ (Velocity Ultra, Thomas Was Alone, etc) as opposed to bigger games like MGS HD and Persona 4. No big deal though, it\\'ll force me to concentrate on Borderlands, and employ a \"beat and delete\" strategy. Then I can move onto other big titles I have waiting in my download queue.', u\"Final Call - this bundle is awesome, and has made me fall in love with the Vita. I take it with me everywhere now, and it's re-invigorated my love for gaming. Having PS+ is amazing, and I don't plan on hitting up Gamestop anymore, just waiting till games either get heavily discounted or free on PSN. For those of you who currently have Vitas, I'd imagine this is a tough sell to buy another one, but for those who don't, this is a great way to get into Vita gaming.\", u'Hope this helps!']", "[u\"Bottom line: The Vita Slim/2000 is the best portable gaming device I've ever owned. It's everything the original Vita was, but better. Lighter, longer battery life, better controls, and an improved screen. I imported a Slim from Japan after my launch Vita mysteriously disappeared from a checked bag (thanks TSA!). I picked up the US bundle as well, and the US Slim is identical (aside from color) to the international versions.\", u'Pros:', u\"- Much lighter and slimmer than the original Vita. It's less noticeable in a coat pocket, fits more snugly in a bag, and is generally a better commuter / travel device than the original. This may actually be a negative for adults with very large hands, as it'll be a bit harder for them to hold comfortably.\", u\"- The battery life is very good. The 4-6 hour advertised life is about right for games like Killzone. It lasts longer if you're plaything through PSOne Classics or simpler games (Spelunky, Guacamelee!, etc.) and longer still if you're playing with the screen at low brightness. My Slim makes it through flights (East -> West coast) that left the original model drained.\", u\"- The shoulder buttons are firmer and have a better action. The Select/Option buttons are larger. I get fewer erroneous inputs on the rear touch pad, although I'm not sure if that's because the pad is smaller or because my grip is better with the new form factor. These are small changes, but they're noticeable as you play and improve the feel of the device vs. the original.\", u\"- The Slim charges and syncs with a standard micro USB cable. This is a major pro! No need to lug the Vita's proprietary power brick and cable when I travel.\"][u\"- The Slim has 1 GB of internal flash memory, which is infinitely better than the whopping 0GB built into the original model. The internal memory is disabled when you insert a memory card, but the bundled 8GB card is enough for Borderlands, another substantial game, and several small games. Heavy users will want a 32GB or 64GB card, but 8GB of space is a decent start if you don't want to pony up immediately or are content shuffling games around. This goes in the pro column since most earlier bundles included only a 4GB card (ACIII, CoD, etc) or no memory card at all (Madden 13).\", u'Mixed:', u'- Fans of the original Vita\\'s rich, over-saturated colors will probably be unhappy with the move to LCD. Me? I think the Slim\\'s LCD screen is a HUGE improvement. My launch Vita\\'s screen had some strange dark/dim spots. I shipped it to Sony, and they sent me a replacement. Its screen had spotting as well, but it was less pronounced (Google \"vita OLED black spots\" and you\\'ll get a lot of pictures/discussion). This is apparently a normal byproduct of the OLED manufacturing process, but it always bothered me. The new LCD is crisp. It may not \"pop\" like the OLED, but the image quality is very good and the colors are accurate instead of over-saturated. The improved color accuracy is especially noticeable if you stream video with Netflix or Hulu.', u'- The Vita\\'s library is a mix of classics, ports, indie games, and original titles. There\\'s a lot to love. Gravity Rush, Persona 4 Golden, Y\\'s, Soul Sacrifice, Metal Gear Solid HD, Rayman, PSP classics like FF Tactics: War of the Lions, tons of top-notch indies. The big Western-style AAA stuff\\'s been competent but unspectacular (Uncharted: Golden Abyss, Killzone: Merc). Overall, it\\'s a great value proposition and a fantastic library for someone like me. I\\'m not home a lot, and when I am I tend to spend my time playing AAA console action games/shooters. I love being able to plod through an RPG while on a plane or work on fast-playing indies like Spelunky and Hotline Miami during my commute. Claims that the Vita \"has no games\" are complete bunk, but the library isn\\'t going to satisfy everyone. Sports titles are pretty much non-existent.', u'[Edit: A commenter correctly noted that Vita gets FIFA and MLB The Show each year, so the major omissions are football (nothing since Madden 13), basketball, and hockey.]', u\"- PS4 Remote Play works surprisingly well at home. Twitchy games like Resogun play like a dream. Slower paced games, like Assassin's Creed IV, are playable away from the house so long as I'm on a fast wireless network. It's a mess on hotel and airport wireless networks. That's unsurprising, since they never have enough bandwidth to go around, but the places where it would be a killer feature are where it's the least usable. Remote Play is nice to have. Just don't buy a Vita thinking it'll be a perfect gateway to your PS4.\", u'Cons:', u\"- While the unit feels solid and comfortable in hand, Sony abandoned the flat front of the original Vita in favor of a screen that looks joined/inset. I'm not describing it well, but it's easy to see in comparison pictures and more pronounced than Sony's press shots and box art suggest. It definitely makes the Slim look a bit lower end from the front on. It's less obvious on my black slim from the bundle than on my white import. The Slim does include some positive aesthetic changes -- it ditches the original's chintzy silver faux-metal band, brushed aluminum buttons, and vestigial accessory port -- but they're not things you LOOK at every time you use it.\", u'- 8GB of storage isn\\'t enough for heavy users. Do you have Playstation Plus? Are you going to use your Vita to play PSP games and PSOne classics? If your answer to either question was \"Yes,\" prepare to shell out another $50-100 for a larger memory card.', u'- The screen is easy to scratch. The original Vita was also scratch prone, and Sony should have improved the build quality in this area for the Slim. Buy a screen protector or handle with great care.', u\"Don't Know:\", u\"- I haven't started Borderlands yet and can't speak to the quality of the port; however, Amazon's product description isn't right. Borderlands 2 for consoles has four player co-op, but Vita co-op is two player only.\"]"], "rating_change": "", "video": ["http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/B1NUEHF62KS.mp4"], "current_price": "$187.95", "count_customer_reviews": "500 customer reviews", "previous_price": "$199.99", "image": ["http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61eCML1J9BL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41OtKy-hqAL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81r9gm6u-bS._SX35_SY46._CR0,0,35,46_PImini-player-shuttle-50px,BottomLeft,-7,12_.png"], "category_path": "Electronics / Video Game Consoles & Accessories / PlayStation Vita / Consoles"}

I looked into this a week ago and saw that some people had one experience and others had another. Maybe it has something to do with which store your item comes from, but I don't know. I ordered the one from Classic Game Source for about $7. It was the one people are talking about that has both the regular composite (yellow) output as well as the hd component (r,b,g). It also has an optional optical hookup for a higher quality audio, although the regular (red and white) cables work great. I didn't have any lines in the picture or anything. On my 32\" 720p tv it makes a huge difference. Now bear in mind that you have to go to the video settings on your xbox (found in the msdashboard) and change your settings to widescreen and enable each of the HD resolutions that your tv supports. And even then few of the games are up to 1080i, although there are a good number that are 720p and even the ones that are just standard STILL look a lot better through this cable. Not every game is made for widescreen so you'll have to switch your tv between 16:9 and 4:3 for whichever game your playing but even then the picture is still great. So maybe some of the other buyers just plugged it in and didn't realize you have to change your settings. I don't know about them, but I am very happy with mine.\n"], ["\n  What needs to be said?

I was pleasantly surprised to find that this cable does much more than just provide component video and stereo audio. Next to the Xbox plug is an optical output - molded into the connnector! There is light coming from the fiber connector (I can't tell you if it works or not as I haven't actually tested it) but just the fact that it's there is a plus. Also, there are two sets of cables that branch off from the Xbox plug. One is standard AV (composite, S-video, stereo audio in the form of RCA plugs) and the other is component video. Where these cables split is a plastic switch box to switch between component and standard video. This does not affect the audio though, you can plug in component video and still use the stereo audio on the other cable.", "Basically, this is an all-in-one, every-output-you'll-ever-need cable for less than the price of some standard composite cables. This works great with standard-def content as well as high-def. I am very pleased with the picture quality on both games and XBMC. One thing to note - it helps if you plug in the S-video connection anyway even if you're not using it. With these non-Microsoft cables, there's usually some stray voltage running through the cable and plugging in the S-video connection makes it go away, and the HD picture quality improves greatly.", "All in all, a GREAT deal!

I was originally an Aperture user, who kept kept trying out Lightroom (LR) every time there was a new version out, but giving up and going back to Aperture. I switched permanently to LR about six months ago, and recently upgraded to LR5. With this review I wanted to give a balanced comparison of the pros and cons between the two programs. At the bottom, I also have some thoughts on the LR4 -> LR5 upgrade.\", u'Aperture is an Apple product and only runs on a Mac; LR is available for both OS X and Windows.', u\"Overall, Aperture and LR are eerily similar. (Aperture came out a few months before LR did, and it looks like both Adobe and Apple have copied each other extensively since then.) The vast majority of their features are shared by both. They are both designed to manage large libraries of photos -- 100,000+ images is not a problem at all.  Their editing tools are both much stronger than simpler programs, such as iPhoto. They both have batch processing, where edits to one image can be applied to a series of photos automatically. Both have 'Smart Collections,' where you can make a virtual library based on various arbitrary criteria. Both have full support for viewing and editing the EXIF and IPTC metadata behind your images. They have similar features for rating images: 1-5 stars, and you can easily compare two photos side-by-side. Both do non-destructive editing, and both are very good with RAW files. You can tag with GPS data easily in either one. Both have broadly similar import and export capabilities. Both allow you to 'brush' on your edits locally (e.g., paint a region to adjust it to higher contrast -- not just make global adjustments).\"][u' Both have robust support for metadata such as keywords, ratings, comments, and flags.', u\"Originally I was drawn to Aperture because of its very smooth interface. It's refined and easy to move around, with a very Mac-like polished feel. It's fast and responsive, and the times that I had use LR it seemed to be slow with a clunky interface. However, I eventually became frustrated with a couple of tools that Aperture has that don't work very well (in particular, the noise reduction and sharpening, and limitation in painting on local adjustments). I switched over to LR and although it still clunky in places, it works well and I'm very happy with it.\", u\"In this review I'm going to go through some of the pros and cons of each one.\", u'Library Management', u'-----', u\"In Aperture, I find it very easy to manage and navigate through my photo collection. When you open it up, you get a full-screen grid view of your folders (with a thumbnail on each), and then by moving the mouse over each folder, you can quickly scan through them and see all the images in the folder without opening them. Super nice, super easy to jog your memory for what's in a shoot without opening it. In LR, the only way to get to a folder is to navigate to its directory in a tiny sub-window (alphabetic order only, and the names are often truncated, so you are wondering what folder 'Beach_J.....R13' really is). I'd love to see Adobe put together a much better Library module to let you scan your photos\", u'Database', u'-----', u\"LR and Aperture use very different philosophies about how to manage files. Aperture's is very much along the philosophy of iTunes: it has an internal `black box' database structure and file structure that only it needs to know about. It will import your photos, put them into its database, and then you can edit them and move them around in different collections yourself. But you do not need to know physically the names of individual directories and subdirectories. LR's philosophy, on the other hand, is that it is essentially an indexer of files that you put onto your drive. You put them there, you tell LR where they are, and it'll keep track of them for you. But if you move or rename a file without LR knowing about it, it will get confused. Personally I like Apple's system better. I don't care where on my hard drive my photos are -- file management is the computer's job, not mine. Apple's system runs the risk that it might get corrupted and you'd have to hunt its database to find your raw files. I suppose that's theoretically a risk, but I've never had the problem myself.\", u\"Here is one example of where LR's file management can get you in trouble. Let's say you have two large folders in LR, with thousands of images. You decide to merge these folders and put all the pictures together into one. You'd think you could just drag all of them from one folder to the other. And you can... until LR complains that some of the photos have the same name. (Assuming you take a lot of photos, you'll end up with multiple photos named DSC_1412.NEF eventually, since the camera recycles names.) You might think that LR would keep track of this itself, or offer to rename the files. But no... in order to merge these directories, you need to manually rename those files -- perhaps thousands of them! -- so there are no duplicated file names. (LR will rename things for you automatically when you import, but not when you copy.) Come on... keeping track of filenames and directory structures is the sort of work that computers were invented for.\", u'Smart Collections / Smart Albums: Both programs let you create virtual groups of images selected by some criteria -- say, all the five-star rated images in your \\'Alaska\\' folder. I use these all the time, in particular for down-selecting to my \\'best of\\' edits. Aperture has one big feature that I miss in LR, which is the ability to resort the order within the Smart Album. Aperture lets you re-order them as you\\'d like, and remembers that order, even as you delete some and bring in new ones. LR simply doesn\\'t -- it brings up a window to tell me \"You cannot change the order of images in a Smart Collection.\" OK Adobe -- rather than telling me I can\\'t do something, why not just let me do it?', u'Interface', u'-----', u\"Aperture's interface is faster, smoother, slicker, and more Mac-like. It requires less clicking and is more seamless to do simple navigation and editing.\", u'I find LR\\'s interface to be rather awkward. There is an explicit distinction in LR between looking at your photos (\\'Library module\\') and editing them (\\'Develop module\\'). It takes an explicit step, and a delay of a second or so, to switch between these. Once you have, the screen redraws, and many of the keyboard shortcuts change wildly (e.g., \"\\\\\" -- toggles between before-after in Develop, but brings up a filter tool in Library).  I\\'ve gotten used to the mode-switching, but it still feels awfully clunky. Want to change contrast? Go to Develop. Edit the caption? Back to Library. Add a vignette, back to Develop... add a keyword, back to Library. Copy settings from *one* photo you can do in Develop, but to apply them to multiple photos you have to be in Library. Crop -- that\\'s Develop. Export photos, Library. Rotate by a few degrees, Develop. Rotate by 90 degrees, Library! Rate photos -- either Library *or* Develop.', u\"Bizarrely, LR does actually allow you to do *some* editing while in Library, but using a smaller set of button-based controls instead of the full set of sliders in Develop. Adobe -- if you're going to put half of the controls there in a limited way, why not just put them all there? This seems really stupid. Better yet, abandon this whole artificial separation between Library and Develop. Make all of the controls work all the time. When you're editing photos from a shoot, you really do go back and forth continually, and it feels awkward and clunky every time.\", u\"Even the basics of the user interface are different in the different modules. Looking an an images and want to move to the next / previous one using the `filmstrip' viewer? You can do that with a two-finger scroll in Library mode. But in Develop -- with the screen looking exactly the same -- that gesture is ignored totally.\", u\"In contrast to all this, Aperture is much more seamless. You're always looking at your photos, and you can edit them, delete them, resort them, everything, right there in one window.\", u\"Undo is a little non-intuitive in LR. Let's say you delete a photo from a collection, then scroll ahead a few photos. If you hit Undo, you'd think that would undo your delete, right? No! What Undo will do is undo the 'Go to Next Photo' command -- it'll just scroll you backwards a few shots... as if you couldn't do that yourself? In order to actually undo that deletion, you need keep hitting Undo. I was using LR for over a year before I realized that LR's Undo stack was more than one level deep (thanks to a comment below!)\", u\"Some of LR's icons are awfully small and hard to figure out. For instance, there are six different icons relating to flagging / rejecting images, and it really takes some squinting to figure out what they are supposed to be -- I mean, one has a tiny 'x' in it, one is dotted with a tiny check mark, and one is an outline with no marks, and then three more are tilted -- and then whether the flag is active or not is shown by whether it is a subtly different shade of dark grey or light grey. And speaking of greys, when you have a grid of images on the screen, even figuring out which picture is the 'active' one is often hard -- LR has at least FIVE different levels of grey backgrounds, which it uses for highlighting the current image, other also-selected images, all images on the page, the image the mouse is hovering over, and images in a stack. You will often actually see all five highlight levels at the same time, and it's really hard to find which one is which. Please Adobe, give up on the zoo of greys! Just let me outline the current image with a big red frame that I can't miss.\", u\"LR has some UI quirks. If you flag and delete the photo you're on now, it'll move you all the way back to the beginning of your folder. Many times if you go to a new folder, you'll also end up at the beginning again -- not where you were before. If you change thumbnail sizes when in grid view, the current image will often move off the screen, rather than stay centered. Small things like this are annoying and Apple really gets them better.\", u\"Aperture's sliders are easier to use. They're wider than LR's which allows finer control, and they have +- buttons on each end to allow you to easily bump up or down the level in tiny increments without having to nudge the sliders in single-pixel movements. It's a nice touch that I wish LR had.\", u\"Aperture's full-screen mode is better for editing than LR's. In LR, all of the controls disappear, although if you remember the keyboard shortcuts, you can make a few primitive edits. Aperture allows you to bring up a translucent panel with the full editing palette.\", u'\\u2028Editing tools', u'-----', u\"The main reason that I switched over to LR was because of its superior editing tools -- specifically, Noise Reduction and Sharpening. Aperture has these, but they are truly awful. Neither makes much of a difference to your images -- they simply don't work. LR's are terrific: they do a good job, and they have a good range (from zero to 'far too much', so you can find a good middle ground for each photo). In Aperture I ended up using the 'NIK Color Efx' plug-in to do my sharpening and noise reduction. That's fine -- those work well -- but they're extra software to buy, and they are not easily undoable, unlike the built-in edits.\", u\"Both have very good control over your lighting and histogram. Both let you crank up the brightness in the shadows. LR's shadow algorithms are better; Aperture's shadow controls are more likely to leave halos.\", u\"LR has a very useful slider called 'Clarity.' It is essentially a mid-tone contrast control, and often brings out great detail that you'd otherwise not see in 'featureless' monotone regions. It's good for clouds and rocks, but it'll mess up faces pretty bad. I use it frequently, though in small doses. Aperture doesn't have anything like it (well, it does have a slider labeled 'Mid Contrast', but it seems to work just like the regular Contrast slider). The effect is similar to NIK's 'Pro Contrast' filter.\", u\"Local edits: Both Aperture and LR let you 'paint' on various adjustments locally, using brushes. But Aperture's painting tools for adjusting exposure are really limited. You can only go up/down by ~1 EV. While that may sound like a lot, if you're trying to darken a sky to match a subject, it's barely anything. You will run into this limitation *all the time*. It's super annoying, and really limits what I can do with Aperture. LR lets you paint on exposure adjustment of up to +- 5 EV. It's incredibly more useful, both for landscapes and really anything where you want to darken the background to focus on the subject. LR also allows more flexibility in changing your local edits after you've made them, and in grouping them together (e.g., if you want to lighten a dark corner, *and* change its color balance, *and* drop the noise, and then make the same adjustments to a different region on another photo, LR makes it very easy to do all this).\", u\"Lens corrections: Vignette and geometric distortion (pincushion, barrel). Aperture doesn't do these at all. LR does them well. They are not done by default on import, but you can easily set up a 'user preset' to do them. At first I thought these were silly in LR, because I could rarely see the difference that geometric distortion makes. But plenty of lenses do vignette, and having automatic correction for a lens defect like this is clearly an advantage. While using Aperture, several year ago I bought DXOptics to do distortion and perspective corrections. It works, but it's a standalone package and I found it too much work to be worth it for the occasional use with Aperture. Photoshop will do these too. But LR is easier and faster.\", u'Chromatic aberration (color fringing). Both Aperture and LR do these. They both work well.', u'** Between Chromatic Aberration and the Vignette / Distortion correction, you really can make up for a lot of lens defects, and give that $100 kit lens a lot of the characteristics that you used to have to but a $2000 lens for. And note that you can *increase* distortion as well as reduce it. Want a fisheye look from your regular rectilinear lens? Just crank down the Scale & Distortion sliders in the Lens Corrections / Manual panel.', u\"LR5 adds the 'Upright' mode, which lets you automatically un-distort things like buildings, and bring them back into normal perspective. LR4 had these same controls, but they were very slow and non-automatic, and they're much more useful now in LR5. I'm sure these will be useful to some people; getting things upright for me is not a big deal (hey, I like them skewed...). When I have played with them they guess right about 50% of the time.\", u\"Gradients: LR will let you easily apply a gradient -- for instance, to bring the exposure of the sky and foreground more in line with each other. This simulates the use of a physical neutral density (ND) grad filter. Assuming you're shooting in RAW which gives you a lot of dynamic range, it's cheaper and more flexible than an ND grad too in most cases. Aperture doesn't have anything like this. You can in theory paint in the EV adjustments, but the range allowed by Aperture is so limited that it's almost useless. LR 5 also adds radial gradients, which you can think of a vignette which is centered on something *not* at the center of your frame. I use this all the time to subtly draw the eye to the subject and mute the background. In Aperture if you have the NIK plugins you can use one called 'Darken / Lighten Center'. While I usually use these gradients to adjust the exposure, you can use them for anything. (Want the contrast to increase from one corner to another for a special effect? Or want the white balance to smoothly change across your image since the lighting color in your room is not uniform? Not a problem.)\", u'File handling', u'-----', u\"RAW files: I find they both work well. I use a Nikon D4 and a Nikon D700. In both cases when you import a RAW file it's going to need some tweaking to get it to look like the in-camera JPEG. But that's the whole point: there are a lot of different ways to convert the RAW file to an image. Both programs do this fine. Both let you apply an arbitrary set of adjustments to your RAW file on import -- so if you know you want everything bumped in contrast with a bit of negative exposure compensation applied, it's not a problem.\", u'Importing: LR won\\'t delete images from your memory card after importing. You have to do it manually. Adobe claims that\\'s a data safety issue, but I have good backups and to me it\\'s annoying: I\\'m much more likely to get in trouble by being in the field with 10 GB of old images on a memory card I forgot to delete, than by having a drive fail and lose my pics. Also, since you will end up formatting your memory cards after every import, it means you can\\'t give them meaningful custom names (\"Card 3\", etc). Aperture will delete files after import if you tell it to.', u\"External editors. Both of them work with Photoshop (Elements, CS6) or other external editors just fine. No difference. I use the NIK tools, and PS CS6. I use Photoshop for removing objects I don't want, stitching panoramas, adding labels, overlaying images, that kind of thing. I don't use NIK nearly as much in LR as I had to in Aperture to make up for its intrinsic limitations.\", u\"Email export. If you want to e-mail a photo from LR, the program brings up a window where you can enter the subject, destination (if you remember their exact address -- it won't auto-complete it for you!), etc. Then you hit Send, and then it copies all this info to the Mac's built-in mail program, where you can edit it, and hit Send *again*, and it's sent. Why not just bring up a regular Mail window in the first place (like Aperture and most other programs do)?\", u\"Quick import and Export. Often times I find I want to take one image and put it on my Desktop for use elsewhere, or conversely take file from the Desktop and bring it into my current library. In Aperture, you just drag the image and it's there. One drag, in or out, and you're done. In LR, dragging the file in or out does *nothing* -- the software just ignores it. So, to get a single image in, you need to go through the whole import process, which must be at least 20 mouse clicks. Same for exporting. Come on Adobe -- make the simple stuff simple!\", u'Extras: Face Recognition, Facebook, GPS, Books, Photo Stream', u'-----', u\"Aperture has a face recognition module where it will help you classify your images based on who is in them. LR doesn't have anything like this. I've spent many hours typing in names to Aperture in order to tag people properly. It does a good job of picking out faces in a picture, but a very poor job of guessing who it is. I find it is far, far faster to go through a folder in LR and manually tag names using keywords, than use Aperture's semi-automated face tagger. Good try Apple, but it's just not there.\", u\"Facebook: LR's built-in Facebook support is pretty weak. I use a plugin from Jeff Friedl for better Facebook support. It's not very slick and has a million different confusing options, but once you get it set up properly it'll work better than the built in one. Except it doesn't let you post on your wall (only to an album) and the developer doesn't know why. Aperture's built-in FB support is smoother, but stupidly, captions you've entered in Aperture don't export as captions to Facebook. (I filed a bug report on this years ago with Apple, but no change except for Apple telling me they know about my request.) Captions do export properly using LR.\", u'Maps: They both import .gpx files and will make nice maps showing your path, etc.  I use a Bad Elf GPS; you can also make similar .gpx paths with many iPhone apps such as MotionX. LR regularly crashes for me in the Maps module when reading GPS tracks. I never lose any work but it takes a minute to restart it and get my brain back on track.', u\"Books: They both make books. I've bought several from Apple and they are very nice. The print quality is a step down from a glossy coffee-table book, but they are still enjoyable. You can customize the format easily. LR makes books too but I haven't used it. Both will output as PDF so you can print them at any capable print shop.\", u'Photo Stream: Aperture integrates nicely with the Photo Stream from your iPhone etc. However, it is not too hard to set up LR to automatically grab your Photo Stream photos  as well, using Automator on the Mac. Search for a post called \"How to integrate iCloud Photo Stream with Adobe Lightroom.\"', u'Upgrades and Purchase Policies', u'-----', u'I kept waiting for Apple to push out some updates for Aperture. The last upgrade with any changes to the editing palette was 3.3 back in mid-2011, which added only minor updates to the white balance tool. There have been minor incremental upgrades to support new camera models, or share libraries with iPhoto, but no new editing features (like fixing the sharpening and noise reduction). That makes it feel pretty abandoned. Adobe has a much more aggressive upgrade schedule, with regular new releases.', u'Free trials: You can download the LR trial and use it for a month for free. Aperture is cheaper, but has no free trial period.', u\"Subscription: I got LR through Adobe's Creative Cloud. A one-year membership (at the student/teacher level) was around the price of LR alone. It gives me free upgrades, like LR5, plus lets me use Photoshop CS6 and a bunch of other stuff, so for me it was a good deal. Lots of people dislike Adobe's move to a subscription-only plan (announced in the spring of 2013). But whether you like the subscription model or not doesn't matter, since *LR itself remains available as a standalone package* (I mean, that's why you're reading a review of it for sale right here). LR is in Creative Cloud if you happen to have that, but you don't have to.\", u\"Stability: They're both stable and crash only rarely (except the Maps module in LR, which must crash 50% of the time I use it -- which is fortunately just once per shoot, so it's not actually a big deal). Once you've made edits on an image and moved to another, all your changes are automatically saved. I've never lost anything on either one.\", u'Conclusion', u'-----', u'Aperture is better at:', u'  o User interface', u'  o Library navigation', u'  o Library management (though part of this is my personal preference)', u'  o Price', u'Lightroom is better at:', u'  o Editing tools. These are photo programs, and this is what really matters.', u'  o Everything else!', u'Lightroom 5', u'-----', u'Regarding the LR4 -> LR5 upgrade, feature-wise this one is pretty slim. It adds:', u\" o Better spot removal -- for instance, much better at taking out power lines and misplaced blades of grass than before. Despite what Adobe says, this is no Photoshop: PS's `Content-Aware Healing Brush' works far far better than LR's spot removal tool. That being said, it is certainly helpful to have another tool in LR for this.\", u\"  o A new radial gradient tool (useful if you want it, but not something everyone will use). You can always simulate this by painting in the gradient with a brush. For me, I use this all the time and it's very nice.\", u'  o Automatic perspective control, to make your sideways-looking buildings upright again. Not a biggie for me, but some people will want it. Among other things, this will give you some of the look of a tilt-shift lens (that is, buildings with walls that go up and down), without the price.', u\"  o You can edit your files while away from your external hard drive (essentially, your edits are made on thumbnails, and synced later with the RAW files). For some people, this feature will be huge. For me, I already have a massive hard drive on my laptop for photos, so this one doesn't matter.\", u'  o Seems faster to me in navigating through the library and loading full-resolution images.', u\"Unless you're really needing one of these new features, you can probably stick with LR4.\", u\"  o [Update August-2013] LR5 will import PNG files, which was not possible in LR4. These are often used for  charts or screen grabs  -- e.g., on the iPhone's Photo Stream, photos are JPG images but screen-shots are PNG. In LR4 the screen-shots were ignored totally when importing a photo stream, which was certainly annoying. Adobe didn't publicize this feature heavily so I didn't realize it until I saw PNG files in my library now. Good to have it.\", u\"  o [Update October 2013] Apple has released Aperture 3.5. It adds support for new cameras, and fixes some bugs. No new features, and no improvements to its ever-more-inadequate editing tools. On the other hand, I am really impressed with Adobe's continual product improvement... there have been updates to LR4/5 every few months, with both bug fixes and new features.\", u\"If you've found this helpful, please click below! And post if you have any questions -- I'll answer them.\"]", "[u'***EDIT*** June 11, 2013: After heavy use of the program, beyond the initial download, installation, and initial use, I offer the following- The interface has no major changes other than the addition of the new features. If you are familiar with LR4, you know it was sluggish.  LR5 is much faster (tested on same machine as LR4). The speed difference was very noticeable.  Importing is also much faster (again, tested on same machine).  On first install, it converts your existing catalog (after giving you a dialogue box) and saves your old catalog files.  Backups also seem much faster. The new features work very well in my opinion. However, the content aware feature is not quite as good as content aware in Photoshop CS6. But, more than good enough for most needs.  I will update again if anything changes.', u'***************', u'ORIGINAL REVIEW', u'***************', u'This is a first impression look at Adobe Lightroom 5.0 (public release, not the BETA).  I am an Adobe Cloud Subscriber and downloaded Lightroom version 5.0 immediately upon release and installed it on my system (\"free\" with Cloud Membership).  My usage and application is in the context of a freelance professional photographer who shoots (for fee) on a part-time basis. I manage two catalogs with Lightroom.  Cutting to the chase, I believe Lightroom 5.0 is a worthwhile upgrade (especially at the upgrade price of $79) because it will add features that will help keep you out of Photoshop, which will speed your workflow and reduce frustration (unless you are a full time post-processing Photoshop master).'][u\"  Arguably, this version of Lightroom will appeal to advanced hobbyists and all pro's, while beginners and others not yet at the advanced hobbyist level will probably continue to choose other less expensive, if not free, editing software.  Important note,  with LR5, Adobe dropped support for Windows Vista and OS X 10.6.8 and earlier versions.\", u'The download and install was painless using my Adobe Application Manager included with the Creative Suite.  I elected to setup Lightroom 5.0 while retaining version 4.0 during my transition.  Of course, I first backed up both catalogs to multiple locations before initiating the install.  I imported my LR4 catalogs into LR5 and was provided the option for additional backups of the old files.  Importing my first catalog file of about 7,000 files and 164GB took over an hour and twenty minutes on a Win 7 64 bit machine w/16gb ram and Core i5 processor).  Personally, I am ok with that.  I encountered no stability issues, Windows freeze, or any other issues.', u'Much has already been written about the features of LR4 and the Beta features of the LR5.  So, I will not write a dissertation in this regard.  I will cover some of the more anticipated (by me) features I believe may influence a LR 4 user choice to upgrade. First off, the Lightroom Interface largely remains the same except for the addition of new tools/features.  One of the most anticipated changes is the spot healing/ clone tool change to more closely replicate the feature found in Photoshop CS6 using Content Aware.  You can still use the Spot Removal tool just as you always have, one click at a time, or use it by dragging over irregular shapes.  This is important to me because I found myself regularly moving from LR4 to Photoshop to use that tool since the LR4 tool did not allow for irregular shapes (it was a limited to a \"spot\" tool).  This feature enhancement alone will save me a lot of time and I found it worked very well.  By no means is Content Aware, either in Photoshop CS6 or LR5, a miracle tools like many non-users believe.  You need to have decent data to work with and preferably with a repeating irregular background such as sand or grass for seam transition.  Another feature that will interest many users of LR4, and that I found worked very well, is the Radial Filter feature, which operates like the Graduated Filter but using a circular mask rather than linear (which works great for non centered vignetting). However, this mask protects the area within the circle and all changes are made outside the circle, providing the same selective editing tools as before (slider options for white balance, exposure, sharpening, noise and moir\\xe9 removal).  Automatic image leveling is also a new feature that could prove to be a major time saver, but on a couple of uses, it seemed prone to error and some corrections result in significant cropping of the image (it does not create pixels to fill resulting blank space from the correction).  These features alone make it a worthwhile upgrade for me.  But also note, I already paid for the upgrade as part of my cloud subscription.  But, even so, I would fork out the $79 for the upgrade if I did not already have it.', u'Adobe chose to do very little with its Slideshow capabilities in my opinion.  I find this surprising and disappointing.  There is very little ability to customize the slideshow and I would call it bare bones since many users will use another program for creating slideshows.  You can add music and mix video and stills, but there is very little text capability.  While Adobe did virtually nothing to the Slideshow, it did add \"Smart Previews\" for off line image editing.  The major point of \"Smart Previews\" is the ability of the user to make changes to image files that are catalogued, but not available; for example, the drive containing the files is not available.  Changes made to an image file offline are later associated once the file comes back online.  While pros will surely benefit from this feature, I doubt most users other than pros will benefit directly (think hobbyist).  I simply do not anticipate a need for this feature at my level of shooting. Now, if someone else was doing my post-processing and we were collaborating, I could see the application.  However, that type of workflow is normally relegated to the pro level.  Also worth noting is Lightroom 5 did not get the new Photoshop Camera Shake Reduction (Photoshop Creative Cloud feature), which I find odd- though it appears Adobe is reserving some features to only the Cloud subscription. The Camera Shake feature can make those slightly soft images tack sharp, though it cannot recover images beyond slightly being soft.', u'Keeping in mind that this is a review after a few hours use, overall I found the speed of Lightroom 5 to be a little faster than LR4, including the importing of RAW image files from a Nikon D300s (would love to hear how it works for D800 users). The entire interface and every module seemed snappier on the same system I used for LR4.  Sure, generating the 1:1 previews can slow you down.  But once done, I can cycle through them very fast.  Though I never had problems with the stability of LR4, I feel compelled to mention I tried to get LR5 to crash with no luck.', u\"For advanced users and most certainly any weeding shooter, Lightroom is a required tool of the trade and an upgrade will probably make great sense.  In my humble opinion, Lightroom is likely not the best option for casual or even hobbyist shooters.  I know too many casual users who purchased Lighroom
